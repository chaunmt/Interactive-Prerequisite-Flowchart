Students will learn the history of previous outbreaks and how they compare to the current COVID-19. Students will learn how to evaluate medical media/information as it regards to COVID-19. The best way to learn about media is to also practice using our physician voice with the public. Students will move from learning about COVID-19 to learning how to share WHO, CDC, MDH, and CIDRAP information about COVID-19 with the lay public through social media in a mentored setting. This course will be completely online, with class group conversations and individual work. \n\n\nBy the end of this rotation students will have a basic background in the history of recent epidemics/pandemics. They will demonstrate that they can use social media to effectively track COVID19 as it progresses. They will demonstrate ability to assess the quality of medical media about COVID19. Students prepare SOCOs (Single Overarching Communications Objective) and talking points. They will learn best practices in social media. Lastly, they will engage in social media to connect people in our state with accurate information about COVID19.\n\nCourse Objectives: By the end of this rotation students will be able to:\nIdentify reliable information sources for COVID-19\nUnderstand basic pathophysiology of COVID-19\nDemonstrate ability to follow local trends on social media\nDemonstrate lateral reading skills, also known as “How to think like a Facto Checker”\nPractice methods for sharing medical information with the general public\nPractice social media message amplification\nUnderstand the history of social media use during disasters in support of health\nEngage on social media under direction to share official (CDC, MDH, WHO) information directly with people asking questions in a timely fashion that relieves/supports official public responses\nBecome familiar with historical pandemics, coronavirus infections, pandemic responses, and public health infrastructure\nUnderstand the Impacts of just in time supply chains on medical care in times of a pandemic\n",

This course is designed for students entering careers in primary care specialties and will provide students with perspective on the diagnosis and management of orthopedic conditions. Each selective will be geared toward the student's desired orthopedic interest. In all rotations, the student is expected to be involved in the clinic setting, pre-operative planning, assisting in the operating room, and post-operative call of patients. Each student will be expected to learn the objectives as outlined in the course description. The student will be expected to attend conferences that are currently active in the residency curriculum. He or she may be requested to present cases as part of these conferences. The experience will be a mixture of diverse clinical exposure in addition to operating room activity. Under direct supervision by orthopedic surgery faculty, the student will create and optimize patient care/management plans, write notes and orders, perform orthopedic examinations, and assist in surgical procedures. The medical student is expected to take call during the rotation; call shall not be scheduled more frequently than once per week.\n\nThe ENT component of the Ortho/ENT selective is two weeks and focuses on general ENT. This course is designed for students entering careers in primary care specialties and will allow students to become familiar with common ENT conditions that they are likely to see in primary care. During the two weeks, students will gain perspective and knowledge on the diagnosis and management of these ENT conditions, including but not limited to middle ear disease, acute and chronic sinusitis, tonsillitis, hoarseness, and epistaxis.
