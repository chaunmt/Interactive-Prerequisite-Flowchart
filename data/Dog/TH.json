    "info": "What is theatre? And what can it be? In this introductory course, we investigate the idea that while theatre is art, it also has consequences. Theatrical performance reflects, resists, and rewrites culture; it can (and does) perform the political by reimagining and transforming society. Through exciting examples of plays and productions from around the world, we investigate the history, politics, and aesthetics of theatre. We explore how the different components of theatre (from directing to acting, costume, and lighting design) come together to create powerful impact on stage. We read and discuss plays in class, see performances on stage, and hear from some of the Twin Cities’s most dynamic and committed artists. And we work on valuable writing skills that help us to deepen our understanding of theatre and communicate our insights to others. At the end of the class, we bring together everything we have been learning to make theatre in small groups. \n\nNo previous theatre experience is needed.",

This course engages with these debates to understand the power of new media to shape our identities and values, our cultural habits and communities, our economy and political life. We discuss how we “perform ourselves” through media, giving rise to social anxieties about truth, authenticity, equality, and belonging, but also to tremendous opportunities for self-expression and connection. And we investigate how our performances are monetized or instrumentalized by governments, social movements, or corporations. How did our current media system develop, and whose interests has it served? How, for better or worse, has the social media age changed us and the world we live in? And how can we make sure that in the future that change is for the better?",

It is a place evocative of wild stunning landscape, exotic wildlife, and a history as a convict colony. Since the birth of the Australian film industry in the 1950's Australian filmmakers have sought to tell their own stories and to interrogate the idea of Australian culture. The global success of films such as Mad Max, Crocodile Dundee, and Priscilla Queen of the Desert have served to reinforce and disrupt stereotypes of Australia as a place and culture. In contrast, films such as Rabbit Proof Fence, Animal Kingdom and The Sapphires seek to tell alternative narratives. Themes such as the urban and rural divide, conquering nature, the place in society of indigenous communities, and fatalism are interrogated\nSimilarly, Australian writers such as Colleen McCullugh, Kate Grenville, Tim Winton, and Liane Morriarty have gained international readership. Their novels, as well as others, use landscape and storytelling to create and challenge simplistic ideas of Australian history and culture.\nBy studying the history and works engaged in creating and interpreting this idea of Australian identity, from Australian artists, students will be asked to engage in a more complex way with the ideas of heritage, culture, and national identity in general. Students will also read selected essays on Australian history and culture. The IDI (Intercultural Development Inventory) will also be used as a tool to engage with the dialogue on identity and culture in general.",
