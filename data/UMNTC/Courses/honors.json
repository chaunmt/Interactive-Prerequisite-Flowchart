    "info": "This is a 2-credit introductory course on financial reporting data analytics for Carlson students. The main learning objective is to introduce students specializing in business (accounting, auditing, tax, finance, marketing, operations, etc.) to data analytics, providing them the necessary knowledge and tools needed to effectively use data analytics in their specialized domain. The goal is thus for students to be able to consume and use available data analytics technologies to complement existing technical skills, rather than to train \"data analytics specialists\" (although this class is a good jumping-off point for students who wish to pursue a career specializing in data analytics). Prior coding experience is thus not required, although students should have completed business statistics (SCO 2550 or BA 2551 or equivalent statistics course). \n\nAfter a general overview of data analytics and machine learning, we will dive into the ETL (extract, transform, load) process, covering topics and showcasing applications such as data joins, variable types, formulas, and regular expressions. We will then explore data visualization tools (including pivot tables and dashboards) and conclude the term by modeling data to create business insights via predictions. Students will gain hands-on experience using state-of-the-art data analytics tools and will learn how to conduct basic SQL queries. Students will improve their quantitative and problem-solving skills and learn how to apply scientific research methods to answer questions, present solutions, and discuss limitations. An emphasis will be placed on financial reporting datasets/applications, although the methods and concepts covered are applicable to other business settings/functions. Ultimately, students will enhance their analytical skills and achieve a deeper understanding of issues related to financial reporting specifically and business more generally.  \n\nprereq: SCO 2550 or BA 2551 or equivalent statistics course; ACCT 2050 or 2051 or 2051H;  BA 3051 is recommended",

We will answer questions such as: How and why did our physiques evolve into the form we see today? What cultural and environmental influences affect human variation throughout the world? What effects do religion, law, and society have on the way people think about, discuss, and use their bodies today? How do we learn about our past from examining human remains? How and why do differences in language use define us as persons? How can anthropological insight lead to great careers in law, medicine, business and public service?",

The thesis is based on original research for the Senior Capstone Project conducted by students in consultation with their advisors, and it is advised that students finish conducting research before enrolling in this course. In some cases it is possible research may continue from the planning course into this seminar. The seminar meets once a week, during which time students engage in active learning exercises, in-class discussions, and peer review as they write their thesis. The goal of this course is to align the writing abilities of students with the writing criteria developed by departmental faculty as part of the Center for Writing\u2019s Writing Enriched Curriculum. This course compliments student\u2019s advisor-advisee relationship for the Senior Capstone Project, and it is required that students set up regular meetings with their advisors to discuss their progress in the course in addition to consulting about the content of their projects. prereq: Sr major, honors student, instr consent",

Students will complete weekly assignments in which they lay the groundwork for the competition.  \n\nThe competition is held in February. During the Fall semester, students engage in research and evaluation of options on the case study. During the Spring semester, students finalize their presentations and compete at the NGA Show with teams from about 18 other universities that are members of the NGA Industry-University Coalition. The competition involves a 15-minute presentation on the first day with 10 minutes of questions and answers. Students are guaranteed to present twice with a second presentation on the second day. Four finalists are chosen for the finals on the third day with the winning team being recognized at the evening banquet and a cash prize.\n\nStudents will also have the opportunity to interact with industry representatives at the show in a number of ways during the four days.\n\nprereq: APEC 1101 or 1101H or Econ 1101 or 1101H\n",

In what ways does the symbolic, open-ended language of art allow artists to imagine otherwise, conjure different futures, and connect to ancestral pasts that co-mingle with present lived experiences? Course readings center BIPOC voices and focus on issues of representation, cultural appropriation, and decolonization. We look at the emergence of \u2018fine art,\u2019 a cultural category steeped in race, power, and the politics of exclusion; the history of the Black art movement and its commitment to political purpose in art; the challenges that arise from the insistence that the political align with the aesthetic. The course explores Indigenous organizing and resurgence as well as the politics of opacity and refusal. We will study socially engaged art forms, Afro- and indigenous futurisms, creative practices that explode distinctions between \u201ctraditional\u201d and \u201cmodern,\u201d art and craft, and engage with art as a field of cultural expression deeply involved in imagining and demanding social justice.\n\nprereq: Honors student",

While it is designed to support Carlson School students writing their honors thesis, students do not need to continue with a thesis to successfully complete the course. In order to both develop your individual thesis as well as learn research methods and writing techniques over the course of a single semester, there will be parallel sets of assignments: one for your thesis (individual) and one for a practice thesis (group). During the first part of the course, your individual thesis project will be emphasized, focusing on finding a thesis topic related to the research of Carlson School faculty who will be supervisors for this academic year. Starting partway through the course, you will be paired with a group of students to work on a practice thesis in which methods, statistical analysis, and writing results are emphasized using pre-specified datasets. Writing is integrated fully into the course. You will be instructed in writing pertinent to research proposals and scholarship, including problem statements, annotated bibliographies, literature reviews, methodology, and reference lists. prereq: Senior honors student",

How were the early writers about Jesus influenced by their social, political, and religious contexts? And why was it reported in the news recently that Jesus was married? In this course we examine the earliest attempts to describe Jesus and his significance in the gospel literature of the first and second centuries and beyond. We ask how historians may claim to \"know\" the \"facts\" of Jesus's life and meaning in light of these various portraits. We seek to understand how the different literary presentations of Jesus reflect their authors' social, religious, and political situations. We aim to understand in more detail the diversity of perspectives about Jesus from the earliest stage of the development of Christianity.

This question is relevant to conservation, agriculture, human health, veterinary medicine, developing artificial intelligence, and understanding the origins of human behavior. This writing intensive course provides a broad introduction to animal behavior. As one of the most interdisciplinary fields in all of biology, understanding animal behavior requires an understanding of cell biology, physiology, genetics, development, ecology, endocrinology, evolution, learning theory, and even physics and economics! This course will draw on questions and methods from each of these disciplines to answer what on the surface appears to be a very simple question: Why is that animal doing that? The course will review such key topics as feeding behavior, reproductive behavior, perception, learning, animal conflict, social behavior, parental care, and communication. Throughout the course, students will be immersed in the scientific process, reading scientific literature, thinking critically, formulating their own research questions, and answering them in an independent project. This is a writing intensive course that covers scientific process and how to formulate research questions. \n\nprereq: BIOL1951 or one of the following: BIOL1001, BIOL1003, BIOL1009, BIOL1012, BIOL1015, BIOL1052, BIOL1055, MATH1241, CHEM1081, CHEM1061, CHEM1071H, PHYS1221, PHYS1301W, PHYS1401V or instructor consent.

We will work with the basics of argumentation: developing a strong, coherent thesis, drafting, the logic of argument, revision, proper citation and effective use of primary and secondary sources, and more. \n\nprereq: Honors, [English major or minor or approved BIS or IDIM program with English area]",

We will explore what makes literature created by the people of the United States distinctly \"American\" during a period that extends from the Civil War and the outlawing of slavery to women's suffrage, workers' movements, the Great Depression, the First and Second World Wars, and the civil rights movement. In addition to reading and analyzing the literature itself in terms of style, form, genre, and language, we will study it in historical context: the complex interplay between the political, the social, the cultural, and the literary in the United States.

Students must discuss their plans with their instructor by the end of the second week of the term. Student and instructor must decide together what additional or enriched work will be required to have the capstone paper count as an honors thesis. Examples of such work include covering the topic in greater depth, using primary sources more robustly, or incorporating more creativity, more synthesis, and/or advanced analysis. Consult with your honors adviser for more details. \n\nThis course also functions as a capstone experience that fulfills many of the Student Learning Outcomes for the English major. In this rigorous and intensive seminar, students receive instruction on writing this paper from tenured and tenure-track faculty in English. Students learn how to choose a topic and formulate a research question, conduct primary and secondary research, and produce a written document that incorporates research and analysis. Faculty teach students to produce an extended, scholarly essay though discussions of method, research, and development; instruction in specific writing techniques; workshopping and revising drafts; solving problems; and creating a coherent and elegant final product. While the subjects about which students write vary depending on student interest and faculty expertise, at least 50% of the course grade is determined by students? writing performance. Most students fulfill the senior paper requirement with a traditional seminar paper, but students sometimes complete alternative projects, such as blogs, analytic projects that incorporate creative or personal elements, collaborative projects, or projects that involve the creation of a podcast, video, web site, or some other means of documenting student learning and writing skills. \n\nPrerequisites for Admission: Honors, Admission to ENGL 3885V also requires English major status and completion of a Critical Theories and Methods course (ENGL 3001W, ENGL 3002, ENGL 4003) or approved transfer course with a minimum grade of C-minus. Priority will be given to students with senior status who have completed the majority of the major requirements, as well as to students who plan to graduate in the term they are requesting to take the senior seminar.",

We will start by looking at the building blocks of good imaginative writing: image, voice, character, setting, story, and revision. We will then move on to a more in-depth examination of three forms: literary nonfiction, fiction, and poetry. Students will learn how to read as writers, obtain an understanding and appreciation for imaginative writing, and gain a sense of themselves as creative writers. We will be trying many exercises and assignments, from brainstorming experiments to final drafts, so come ready to write.\n\nSince this is an Honors course, it is designed to be challenging and to immerse students in the literary landscape. The literary citizenship requirement will take students beyond the normal classroom environment and into the community to attend and respond to readings. We will also supplement the textbook with classroom visits and additional readings by the most exciting and innovative poets, fiction writers, and creative nonfiction writers working today. Students will also contribute to the course readings by presenting a poem of their choosing to the class, explaining its techniques and importance. This will tie in with larger discussions of what works gain popular and academic attention and how this happens, including investigations of the role of anthologies and social media.\n",

Students must discuss their plans with their instructor by the end of the second week of the term. Student and instructor must decide together what additional or enriched work will be required to have the capstone paper count as an honors thesis. Examples of such work include covering the topic in greater depth, using primary sources more robustly, or incorporating more creativity, more synthesis, and/or advanced analysis. Consult with your honors adviser for more details. \n\nThis course also functions as a capstone experience for the English major and the Creative Writing minor. To graduate with a BA in English, students with an interest in creative writing may choose to produce a substantial manuscript of poetry, literary fiction, or literary nonfiction rather than an extended, scholarly essay. In this advanced creative writing workshop, students receive instruction on writing this manuscript from tenured and tenure-track faculty in English. Class sessions typically include in-class writing exercises, which are then expanded into more finished works of poetry or prose reviewed by the faculty and discussed in workshops by the students themselves. Writing exercises and assignments lead, at the end of the semester, to a finished, thoroughly revised manuscript. Faculty teach students to produce a significant body of poetry, fiction, or creative nonfiction though discussions of method, craft, and development; instruction in specific writing techniques; workshopping and revising drafts; solving problems; and creating a coherent and elegant final product. While the subjects about which students write vary depending on student interest and faculty expertise, at least 50 percent of the course grade is determined by students' writing performance. \n\nPrerequisites for Admission: (1) Honors candidacy in English, (2) English major status and completion of a Critical Theories and Methods course (ENGL 3001W, ENGL 3002, ENGL 4003) or approved transfer course with a minimum grade of C-minus, (3) completion of at least six credits of creative writing courses, including one intermediate (ENGW 3xxx-level) or advanced creative writing workshop, preferably in the genre of the ENGW 3885V workshop to which you are applying; and (4) submission of a creative writing sample.

Dinosaurs, most famous among the reptilian clades, dominated terrestrial ecosystems for over 100 million years and evolved large body sizes unsurpassed by any other terrestrial group. This course will cover the fossil record, evolution and paleobiology of reptiles (including birds) from the Carboniferous to the Present. Using both literature and demonstrations on skeletons/casts, students will learn the basics of reptilian anatomy and biology, and how those are used to infer evolutionary relationships and ecology of the diverse extinct reptilian clades listed above. Methods for inferring phylogenetic relationships, measuring biodiversity in the fossil record, and reconstructing the physiology and life history strategies of extinct reptiles will also be covered. The relationship between major geological events, such as changing climate and continental drift, and the origination, diversification, and extinction of reptilian groups through more than 300 million years of in Earth history will be explored. \nPrerequisites: ESci 1001 or ESci 1002 or Biol 1001 or Biol 1002 or Biol 1009 or instructor consent.",

You might not know that the number of cryptocurrencies is fast increasing and might soon be about 1000 of them. Depending on that day\u2019s price, there might be a 100 cryptos with a notional market cap above one billion and about 15 above 10 billion. You will learn that cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile. Is it all hype or this the shape of our future? Will this be another Tulip craze? How will they effect regular commerce? Are they just digital gold? How will governments step in to regulate them? Will Governments issue their own Digicoins?\nIn this course, we will not be able to answer all the above questions. However, you will gain a basic understanding of the new technology that is based on cryptography. We will discuss what it provides and where it is still lacking. We will revisit the role of money and what makes a currency successful. We will then examine the properties of cryptocurrencies and ask what it would take for them to be a store of value and/or a medium of exchange. To do this we will start with some fundamental concepts from cryptography that would allow you to understand the technology beyond some stretched analogies. We will discuss the economics of these currencies and the regulatory issues facing governments. We will then delve into the use cases: Primary markets (ICOs & venture capital), secondary markets and exchanges, smart contracts, and potentially settlement activities in clearing houses.\n\nprereq: FINA 3001 or FINA 3001H or APEC 3501; CSOM mjr or Math mjr or NONM",

You will\ndevelop a set of skills and concepts that will permit you to understand and to analyze the foundations of the economy at large. We want to understand the main drivers of economic growth over time and across countries. Key skills and conceptual take-aways from this course:\n1. Explain how an economy, firms, labor, and finance fit together.\n2. Able to use the Solow and Romer growth models: i) to understand long term growth, ii) to\npredict shock effects, iii) to measure TFP iv) to examine GDP differences across countries\n3. Understand labor market using supply and demand, and using the bathtub model\n4. Able to analytically derive the classical gains from free trade. Understand key benefits and\ndrawbacks to globalization.\nThe lectures are structured as Foundations, Growth, Labor, Globalization. We start by setting up a foundation that stresses the fact that things have to fit together coherently. We need to be careful about how we measure things. The role of firms and financial markets are frequently\nmisunderstood so we devote special effort to why these exist and what role they play.\n\nNext we turn to the overall evolution of the economy \u2013 sometimes called mega-trends. People open underestimate the amount of economic variation from one decade to the next and hence may not adequately prepare. A key purpose of this course is to help you understand key\ndrivers of economic growth, and the wealth difference across time and between countries. This will provide context for you to think about some potentially forthcoming major changes.  The role of labor deserves special attention since it connects directly to human beings. The\ntreatment of, and returns to labor are critical to human welfare. We will consider the labor market in general, unemployment, and inequality both within and across countries.\n\nFinally we will examine the role of globalization and international trade. We will formally develop the classical gains from free trade. We will also discuss the reasons for controversies surrounding trade and globalization.\n\nprereq: 3001 or 3001H, CSOM major or Math major/Act Sci, or Management minor.",

We then turn from theory to practice, and to the question, how can we frame our questions, and enact our research in humble and ethically principled ways?  Students will respond to this task by designing collaborative research projects.  They will first identify and define a real world issue; they will review different disciplines' methods for defining and approaching the issue, and then they will jointly create a collaborative research design.

Drawing on a wide range of interdisciplinary sources including magazines, novels, films, and digital media, these questions may include: How do cultural representations of the Global South reinforce European imperial and colonial projects? What role do mass-market magazines and newspapers have in constructing difference and producing stereotypes that justify imperialist attitudes? How does the development of technologies, from railroads to the internet, affect collective experiences of time and space? How is 'fake news' and intentional misrepresentation a threat to democracy and to the ecological security of the Earth?

Specifically, students are asked to regularly solicit their thesis advisor for specific kinds of feedback on draft writing samples, meet with the faculty member to go over this feedback, and then write up a plan for incorporating the feedback into subsequent drafts. HCOL3103V assumes that the bulk of the work devoted to developing a thesis topic, consulting secondary sources, collecting data, doing analysis, and producing creative output has already been completed. Hence, assignments in HCOL3103V prompt students and thesis advisors to meet regularly in service of crafting prose appropriate for their discipline and project. The final assignment comprises the submission of the completed thesis draft to the full thesis committee. [This is an optional course for students seeking a Writing Intensive requirement while completing their Honors Thesis. UHP students must still take the required thesis support coursework -- either HCOL 3101H, HCOL 3102H, or the required thesis course in their department.

    "info": "Science and technology influence nearly every aspect of our daily lives as well as the communities in which we live, both locally and globally. How did science and technology become such ubiquitous and powerful aspects of American industry, government policy, public life, and international negotiation? What are the responsibilities of scientists and engineers who play a critical role in creating and maintaining these elements? How can the broader public position itself to provide encouragement, insight and critique of the research and applications of science and technology? This course is intended to examine these questions by exploring historical case studies that highlight ethical, political, and social issues that give meaning to, and in turn, are shaped by science and technology. Beginning with the role of scientists as professional experts in the Progressive era, we consider how ideals of scientific management impacted animal lives and workers = bodies. Ethical choices frame the application of expertise and require attention and specific decision-making. Using eugenics as an example, we will reflect upon the interplay between the often na\u00efve understanding of heredity and public policy and continue discussion into the application of contemporary genetic testing. Ethics are framed in social and political settings, and we will follow sometimes surprisingly comparable developments in Russia and the United States, with particular attention to large-scale engineering projects in the 1920s and 1930s and the space race in the 1950s and 1960s in order to understand how these reflected, or failed to reflect, risk and human life. This course meets the Historical Perspectives, Civic Life and Ethics, and Writing Intensive requirements as defined by the Council on Liberal Education. Along with Student Learning Outcomes, these requirements will help you continue to build critical tools for your work at the university as well as ways to evaluate and create knowledge in and beyond your intended career area.",

But childhood can also be a time of great confusion and uncertainty; of doubt, turmoil and anxiety. Through select pieces of short fiction, prose, essays and cinematic works, we will analyze the popularity of the coming-of-age genre (or Bildungsroman) as a primary mode of formative response within the African world literary tradition. We will consider how the autobiographical or semi-autobiographical story, told by a narrator who is growing up and becoming conscious of their body, their familial and wider social surroundings, their emotions, their very identity, dramatizes the cultural, political, and historical contexts in which it is set. Through our exploration of socialization as a thematic component of the Bildungsroman, we will examine how \"coming-of-age\" comes to represent something very different for boys and for girls.",

Everything from hip-hop to rock to jazz to bluegrass to \u0093Americana\u0094 to folk to the singer-songwriter tradition and beyond has been profoundly shaped by the roots music we\u0092ll study this semester.  \n\nThe course is divided into three parts.  In the first, we\u0092ll examine the meanings the music had for the people who made it and recorded it in the early decades of the twentieth century: African-American singers, blues musicians, and \u0093songsters\u0094 who labored in the south under oppressive Jim Crow conditions and forged new musical traditions; and white Appalachian peoples who were moving from farm work to work in coal mines and textile mills and combining European musical traditions with those of African-Americans to create new sounds and new sonic landscapes.  In the second part of the course, we\u0092ll examine what the music means to us, to contemporary audiences, by analyzing recent films in which roots music is featured and its story told.  And in the third part of the course, we\u0092ll ask what the music has meant to scholars and analyze the ways in which, from the 1930s to the present, they\u0092ve traversed the south with notepads and recording devices to preserve the music and to learn about the musicians.  Here we\u0092ll dip into the vast repositories of primary source material now available online (field notes, recordings, photographs, interviews) and try to find new ways to understand and appreciate roots music for ourselves, and try to solve some of its mysteries through our own research.",

As a strategy of being, these contemporary artists seem to use art to engage their audiences in a dynamic dialogue concerning certain aspects of contemporary life. These and other artists want to interpret political reality in order to change it; that is, to bring about social and political transformation through aesthetic means. This course will provide an overview of the ideas, strategies, and work of the artists as a critical lens for viewing the changing cultural and political landscape of an increasingly technological and globalized world.\n\nThis course will take a comparative studies approach to the development of contemporary art in its historical, its social and political contexts, the increasing influence of the Western art in Asia, Africa, and other parts of the world, and the cross-cultural communication customs and protocols of international art practice and art criticism. Methodologically, this course first aims at integrating four major disciplinary approaches in discussing art history from post-WWII to the present day: historical studies, sociological studies, psychoanalytic studies and cultural studies. Such an integrated approach will provide a framework and a reference point for us to describe and understand contemporary art in certain historical and political contexts.",

What are they worried about, and how do they try to keep themselves safe  and secure? The quest for national security has taken shape at the level of foreign policy and military engagement. At the same time, Americans have endeavored to achieve their own safety and security through political and personal efforts. This seminar examines the various ways that citizens have addressed the issue of security in their own lives, whether their fears have been justified, and whether their efforts have kept them safe. The goal is for students to understand the issue of security in a historical context, and to enable them to be effective citizens in a world that often feels dangerous.",

In the ensuing three years, there have been on-going commemorations of the major battles and events that marked the war\u0092s trajectory. The importance of the war to the psyche and memory of some of the participants was illustrated when, in 2009 Harry Patch, the last surviving veteran of WWI, broke his ninety-year silence on his wartime experiences to declare that the war had been \u0093legalized mass slaughter\u0094.  When he died shortly afterwards, he was given a funeral with full military honors, which was watched by millions on television. Why did this war happen when it did and why, nearly one hundred years later, did a veteran, about whom virtually nothing was known beyond his longevity, qualify for the honors that were usually afforded generals and statesmen? Three years earlier, in 2006, the 306 British soldiers shot for \u0093cowardice\u0094 were pardoned.  What does this tell us about the way mentalities about war have changed? This course will look at the history, literature, and ethics of the war that was known in French as the \u0093Der de la Der\u0094 (the last of the last) and which marked over three generations of Europeans creating a legacy that was incorporated into the national identity of those taking part.",

Advocacy messages provide organizations with a tool for promoting change, forming attitudes, and furthering dialogue about substantive issues. By engaging in advocacy, organizations enter into a public dialogue about issues that it views as significant in the realization of its goals and objectives.\n\nThis seminar seeks to answer questions such as: What contribution does organizational advocacy make to public dialogue? How does corporate advocacy represent the goals and needs of the organization and society? What are the social implications of organizational advocacy? Our goal is to understand organizational advocacy beyond a single issue, campaign, or corporation. To achieve our goal, we will examine a variety of communication theories and international, national, and Minnesota-based campaigns.",

    "info": "Connections between linguistics (the scientific study of human language) and biology (the scientific study of life and living forms) have a long history. Most contemporary linguists view language as part of human cognition, rooted in biologically determined predisposition to acquire language and constraints on the properties of what can be acquired. Before the Chomskyan revolution in the early 1960s, the connection was largely restricted to anatomical properties of the human vocal tract involved in articulation of speech sounds and the role of evolution of the vocal tract in making human language possible. Other connections included metaphorical borrowing of terms from biology, such as genetic relationships among related languages grouped into language families, whose members shared the same ancestor language. More recently, the focus has turned to the biological basis of human language, the existence of language genes and connections between evolution of language and evolution of the human brain. There has also been some influence of linguistic methodology on the field of biology, with researchers proposing similarities between generative models of linguistic codes (grammars) and the genetic code. This course will examine the relationship between linguistics and biology, and how it reflects development of the field of linguistics and cross-disciplinary influences in general.",

And why do we go to concerts, since electronic media and the internet provide such an easy access?

We will investigate various dimensions of human evolution and applications of different evolutionary ideas to understanding ourselves with a special focus on health and disease. Then we turn to how humans alter or control the evolutionary process through domestication, conservation of species, and climate change. Finally, we look at the intersection of evolution and religion in the public sphere, the evolution of ideas about the human species (including questions about biological race realism), and how both culture and language evolve.

Everything from hip-hop to rock to jazz to bluegrass to \"Americana\" to folk to the singer-songwriter tradition and beyond has been profoundly shaped by the roots music we'll study this semester.\n\nThe course is divided into three parts. In the first, we'll examine the meanings the music had for the people who made it and recorded it in the early decades of the twentieth century: African-American singers, blues musicians, and 'songsters' who labored in the south under oppressive Jim Crow conditions and forged new musical traditions; and white Appalachian peoples who were moving from farm work to work in coal mines and textile mills and combining European musical traditions with those of African-Americans to create new sounds and new sonic landscapes. In the second part of the course, we'll examine what the music means to us, to contemporary audiences, by analyzing recent films in which roots music is featured and its story told. And in the third part of the course, we'll ask what the music has meant to scholars and analyze the ways in which, from the 1930s to the present, they've traversed the south with notepads and recording devices to preserve the music and to learn about the musicians. Here we'll dip into the vast repositories of primary source material now available online (field notes, recordings, photographs, interviews) and try to find new ways to understand and appreciate roots music for ourselves, and try to solve some of its mysteries.",

Currently, there is intense debate around the establishment of new mines in northern Minnesota to exploit the metals necessary for the manufacturing of technology, specifically the metals needed to sustain green energy initiatives. This seminar will address the question \"How green is green energy\" by exploring the delicate balance among resource availability, societal energy needs, ethical land management, and ultimately climate change and long-term sustainability. To gain perspective on this complicated balance we will first learn about the Earth System, climate change, and energy resources. We will then review the geologic processes that formed mineral resources in northern Minnesota and how the exploitation of these resources has impacted local cultures and economies. The last part of the semester will focus on the current debate about mining in northern Minnesota and the broader framework of sustainable energy. \n\nThrough readings and discussions, you will gain an appreciation for the multidisciplinary and multicultural perspectives related to human interactions with our environment, energy needs, and the importance of effective communication.",

In the latter category, the goal is to provide you with a thorough understanding of the basic ideas behind special relativity, general relativity, and quantum mechanics. To achieve this goal we will only need a modest amount of mathematics, which I will develop without presupposing more than the most basic high-school algebra and geometry. Since this material, however, calls into question deeply entrenched ideas about space and time and the nature of physical reality, you should be prepared to challenge yourself, conceptually and mathematically.

    "info": "Recent poll data suggests that many Americans are questioning the value of higher education. For example, 2/3 of those surveyed stated that colleges are stuck in the past and not meeting the needs of today\u2019s students. What is the purpose of college? Should a 4-year degree be accessible to all? Does a college education lead to attaining the \u201cgood life?\u201d In this interactive honors seminar, we will address these questions and more. Students will have the opportunity to examine their own objectives as it relates to pursuing higher education and explore important issues impacting higher education (e.g., student debt, access, and admissions). Students will engage in regular reading, writing, and discussion around critical issues in higher education. Small group interaction, presentations, media analysis (e.g., podcasts, films), and ongoing reflection will be features of this seminar. \n\nThe course will be organized around three main units, each guided by a specific question that we will aim to address. Unit 1 will address the question \u201cWhat is the history of higher education, and what are the reasons for pursuing a degree? Unit II explores: \u201cWhat are key current topics in higher education that deserve exploration?\u201d As a part of this unit, we will discuss trends and issues that address the mission of higher education, especially post-pandemic. Unit III will examine the question, \u201cHow do your own experiences in college align with your own personal and professional objectives?\u201d",

This formalism is much easier to learn than most of its applications in physics (which typically require a fair amount of calculus). And mastering this basic formalism suffices to understand some of the key ideas behind such exciting recent applications as quantum computing and quantum cryptography (which will also be addressed in this seminar). The humanities component consists of a critical review of the history of the debates over the foundations of quantum mechanics from the late 1920s to the present. The seminar thus has two main objectives. The first is to introduce students with a wide variety of backgrounds to an exciting area at the intersection of physics, mathematics, and computer science challenging our understanding of the physical world but at the same time suggesting new ways of harnessing nature for our purposes. The second is to combat simplistic views of \"The Scientific Method\" by tracing in a concrete and engaging example how science is actually done\u2014warts and all.",

Holmes\u2019s explanation of how some crime was committed tends to be so convincing that it counts as evidence that it was actually committed that way. Although our use of it is seldom as clever as Holmes\u2019s, we rely on IBE all the time in everyday life. So do scientists. In science, however, IBE tends to be less reliable. That a theory explains a range of phenomena does not make that theory true. In other words, we cannot simply take a theory\u2019s explanatory power as evidence for it. Yet, scientists tend to put great emphasis on their theories\u2019 explanatory power if they want to convince others of it. Which raises the question: What exactly is the relation between explanation and evidence in science? In this seminar, we will examine this relation, using  examples from everyday life, crime fiction and the history of science (involving such luminaries as Copernicus, Newton, Darwin and Einstein). To improve our understanding of IBE we will contrast it with a probabilistic account of evaluating evidence known as Bayesianism.",

In this interdisciplinary seminar, we will study how Russians have conceived of and used nature from the medieval period to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Articulating a particular approach to nature has been integral to several ideological and cultural projects in Russian history, including the formation of a literary tradition, the establishment of a multi-ethnic empire encompassing several biomes, and the development of a vision of Soviet science conquering and reshaping nature and the world. In the period we will study (the fifteenth century to 1991 Russia) underwent several profound epistemological shifts, and a particular focus of this course will be how the ways Russians created natural knowledge changed over time. Knowledge is power, and we will study how natural knowledge was used to strengthen and expand the state in the medieval, imperial, and Soviet periods. Another major focus of this course is the ravages that nature and humankind have inflicted on one another, and we will study how the environment influenced the development of Russia's form of agricultural slavery, serfdom, as well as the history of environmental degradation, including deforestation, the establishment of heavy industry, and nuclear disaster.",

Those decisions are both scientific and cultural and like any such decisions have their critics and detractors. We will discuss genetic markers and measures for population diversity and how such tools can be leveraged to gain knowledge about crop diversity, make management decisions, and create improved varieties. However, food is cultural, and for many our relationship to crops is central to identity. Therefore, we will also examine who is privileged and left out of dominant narratives, and explore alternate ways of understanding crop diversity and preservation.

The readings and lectures will cover literature in systems ecology, energy and natural resources, thermodynamics, history, anthropology, human behavior, neuroscience, environmental science, sociology, economics, globalization/trade, and finance/debt with an overarching goal to give students a general understanding of how our human ecosystem functions as a whole. Such a systems overview is necessary to view the opportunities and constraints relevant to our future from a realistic starting point. Though the hard science relating to sustainability will be surveyed, few answers will be presented and it is hoped that creativity and group dialogue will lead to emergent ideas on how these big themes fit together.  While the class material is daunting and intense (reflecting our world situation), the course itself will be enlightening and deeply informative, with an open, engaging, and entertaining class atmosphere.",

    "info": "Climate change presents an almost unimaginable crisis to our existence. Its profoundness is coupled with an urgency to find solutions that contribute to collective and transformative actions. There is scientific consensus that the existence of human beings (and many other species) on the planet is in danger because of fossil fuel emissions. Human activity has led to increasing greenhouse gases (especially carbon dioxide) and a warming planet.  A warming planet has negative consequences in terms of environmental degradation, extreme weather events, and social disruption\u2014all of which have health and economic consequences.  While the basic problem is acknowledged by scientists in diverse fields, many of the proposed responses to the current and projected climate-related changes are contrary to powerful political, cultural, industrial, and economic interests. The challenges posed by these interests, as well as the complexity (and sometimes imprecision and uncertainty) of the science, make it difficult for individuals to clearly understand the threats and the opportunities that must be addressed in the next several decades if the earth is to remain habitable for almost 9 million species. Hearts and minds must change quickly.  Public and professional educational efforts must be massive, with clear messages of hope, urgency, and direction.  Local, national, and global adaptation and mitigation responses must thus be palatable and accessible to diverse communities as well as to powerful economic and political entities.  Policies, programs, services, and educational efforts must necessarily be created by multidisciplinary teams using community-focused approaches.  These efforts must reach all affected individuals and entities, especially those who are most vulnerable to the negative sequalae of climate change.  They must also effectively address the many political, social, and cultural barriers to the kind of transformative actions that are necessary to maintain the habitability of the planet.  The course will take a multidisciplinary perspective to encourage students to learn and critically evaluate information about three major content areas: (1) the science of climate change and its public health contextualization; (2) the existing, and projected, consequences of climate change to the environment, to human health, and to institutions and infrastructures that affect public health; and (3) public health mitigation and adaptation responses for industries, governments, communities, and individuals.

    "info": "Writing is the fundamental technology of civilization. It sets an imaginary boundary between history and prehistory, between educated and not, even between civilized and primitive, in the common way of thinking. Writing is ubiquitous today \u2013 I am doing it right now, and you are reading what I am doing \u2013 to the point that we take its nature and value for granted. This seminar scrutinizes our most universal technology and our ideas about it, by inquiring into the origins, development, disappearance, and decipherment of different writing systems.\n\nWhy and how was writing invented? What difference did it make to society once it was invented? Who learned to read and write in antiquity, and what did they write? When people learned a writing system, did they write in their own language, or did they learn to write in the\nlanguage of the people who invented the system? And how did modern scholars figure out how to read what people once wrote in long-forgotten, extinct writing systems? These are among the questions to be explored in the seminar. We will focus on writing systems developed in and\naround the ancient Near East: cuneiform in Mesopotamia, proto-Elamite and linear Elamite in Iran, hieroglyphics in Egypt, the alphabet in the Levant, Linear A and B in the Aegean, Anatolian hieroglyphics, Old Persian cuneiform, and Meroitic. The class will also examine writing systems developed in other parts of the world in antiquity: the Indus Valley, China, and Mesoamerica. You will learn about the origins and development of the script, how it worked, what language(s) it was used to write, and what kinds of texts people wrote. In the case of extinct scripts, you will also learn the story of its decipherment \u2013 or of attempts to decipher it, in the case of scripts such as the Byblian syllabary, Cretan hieroglyphics, and Linear A. Meanwhile, we shall discuss how ancient cultures of western Asia, northeastern Africa, and the Mediterranean influenced each other in developing their various writing systems; how people and states used particular scripts and languages for internal or external communication; and the value of literacy versus orality. Examining these phenomena in diverse cultures of the ancient world will provide a wealth of analogies to the contemporary world, and will raise questions about how writing and literacy function in society and in the mind.",

Centered on the idea of a perfected world, utopian thinking has motivated a wide variety of political and social movements as well as literary and cultural practices. In this course, we will explore the ways that utopian ideas find expression in cinema.  We will examine the conceptions by means of which utopian longings are given cinematic form \u2013 from satires that expose the wrongs of society in order to imagine change, and culinary fantasies about the fulfillment of the senses, to the role of humor in conceptualizing change. To this we should also add the importance of considering how the visual image intimates the future \u2013 by not showing as much as by showing.\n\nWe will look at formal film language as well as narrative concerns in order to grasp various aspects of the ideal of utopia as expressed in cinema.  Through an encounter with a range of American and European films, our goal will be to consolidate an overall understanding of the politics of utopian thinking. Please note that prior familiarity with film or cultural theory is not required, but all students taking a 3xxx-level honors course are expected to demonstrate their ability to think critically, write well, and make good arguments (regardless of disciplinary location).",

This class examines processes of racial formation in science, law, history, immigration policy, education, leisure, adoption, marriage, and medicine. The course investigates how Americans came to mythologize, understand, identify, and codify the importance of race since the mid-nineteenth century. Racial formations and classifications shift according to political climates, such that immigration debates, changing gender norms and concerns over interracial marriage transform how we imagine racial groups. We will also look at how race has been used to pathologize, eroticize, vilify, fetishize, and medicalize purported \u2018problem people,\u2019 like immigrants, the poor, and the sick. For instance, seeing people of color as particular hazards during pandemics, like the 1918 Influenza or 2020 COVID-19 crises, has deep roots in longstanding racial theories. Using memoirs, legal cases, history of medicine, laws, photographs, oral histories, and secondary source readings, this class traces the history of America\u2019s fascination with race and how race came to define so many aspects of American life during the twentieth century.\n\n",

    "info": "At a time of rising income inequality, in which billionaires grow richer while millions struggle to survive, this course will examine the social, environmental, economic, and ethical aspects of consumption and poverty through the lens of three basic needs: food, clothing, and shelter. It seeks to help you answer three key questions: what should you eat, what should you wear, and where should you live, so that others might do the same. We will begin by exploring the theory and practice of simple living through three comparisons: the realities of social and environmental insecurity versus the ideals of Sustainable Development; voluntary simplicity as historically practiced by communities as opposed to individuals; and the movement for degrowth compared to business as usual. In the central portion of our course, we will consider several contemporary forms of simplicity that exist alongside the \"involuntary simplicity\" often dictated by poverty: cooking at home and eating lower on the food chain because it is virtuous rather than because it is cheaper; shopping in thrift stores and buying fewer clothes because you want to rather than because you have to; and camping and living the #vanlife because you can rather than because you must. In our exploration of simple living and basic needs, we will address major issues in sustainability studies, including the Anthropocene, decolonial approaches to economics, and effective altruism, and we will consider a range of literary and historical perspectives on food, fashion, and architecture, such as Henry David Thoreau's \"Walden,\" Marie Kondo's \"The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up,\" Sarah Susanka's \"The Not So Big House,\" and the films \"The True Cost,\" \"The Minimalists,\" and \"Nomadland.\" Throughout our course we will also attempt to answer two big questions about simple living: Is it the ultimate embodiment of white, middle-class, leisure-based U.S. environmentalism, or is it part of a global, multicultural challenge to the racist and colonial foundations of capitalism? Does it express some profound truths about the human condition, or will it never be anything more than a niche response to the social and environmental challenges of the 21st century? Requirements will include attendance and participation, a series of short reading responses, several reflective writing assignments, and a final project exploring some aspect of our subject in greater depth.",

The particularities of this meaning, however, do shift\u2014according to cultural norms, political pressures, and social changes. This class will ask us to consider what \u201ctragedy\u201d means, from its original context in the dramatic genre, in which political regimes are shaken and often a good number of important people die (Sophocles\u2019 Oedipus Rex cycle, Shakespeare's King Lear, Racine's Ph\u00e8dre), to its appearance in novels, politics, current events, and contemporary theory. What happens when the notion of tragedy moves out of the ritualized space of the dramatic performance and into other languages, venues, and political arenas?  Is the death of a parent or a child a tragedy? To what extent is contemporary warfare a tragedy? Is food insecurity a tragedy? Is the tragic something we can know only in retrospect, and should we get better at \u201chandling\u201d it? Beginning with literature, this course will examine the components of the tragic, its role in our culture, and what its presence in discourse says about our moral landscape. Interventions from the medical field, bio-ethics, architecture, art history, media and film, anthropology, theater history and performance studies, communications and journalism, religious studies and more can be integrated into our program.

    "info": "This honors seminar uses memoirs\u2014non-fictional life stories narrated in the first person\u2014as a lens into the past and, just as importantly, as a way to investigate what counts as \u201chistory\u201d itself.  The relationship between personal narratives and professionally produced histories is often fraught or confused, even though both can reasonably be understood as forms of creative non-fiction.  Is the memoirist responsible to the historical record in the same way as an historian?  Does the historian know how to assess and appreciate the power of personal memory?  What kinds of memoirs do historians write?  We will examine a range of memoirs that speak variously about historical and emotional truths, about memory and identity and place, about the ability of individual experience to illuminate a broader social and political history.  We will attend to the narrator\u2019s voice and explore how certain kinds of writing enable (even produce) certain kinds of discoveries.  Throughout, we will discuss the gains and the limitations of using personal stories to understand past experience. \n\nA note of clarification: while autobiographies tend to be chronological narratives of most of a person\u2019s life (without the ending, of course), memoirs focus more selectively\u2014and often without regard to linear chronology\u2014on crucial moments or themes in the narrator\u2019s experience.  This course prioritizes memoirs over autobiographies, and it takes most of its examples from the boom in memoir writing over the last three decades.  It does not offer a history of memoir as a genre. In particular, it features memoirs that go beyond the experiences of an individual narrator to reveal broader social and political contexts.",

We will examine the role of dehumanization, compartmentalized thinking, and perception, personality predispositions, etc. To counterbalance the pessimism inherent in this focus, we will also examine political heroism and altruism, which often arise in response to malignant political aggression. Are these resisters ordinary or extraordinary people, and how do they differ from perpetrators? How many ethical 'kudos\u2019 do they deserve and why? What is their role in instantiating the larger norms of ethical conduct in our political system? In examining these more general forces, we will rely on specific examples such as the holocaust, the massacre at My Lai, the rescuers of Le Chambon, and several others. Finally, through the lens developed in this seminar, we will assess U.S. government actions, and resistance to those actions, of the last four years.",

Yet they intend to capture something about their own lived experience that, when recounted with as much candor as possible, will illuminate their personal past in ways that speak to others.  When historians bring their skills of critical historical analysis to their own lives, what kinds of autobiographies do they produce?  How is their understanding of the craft of history, its methods and its limitations, reflected in their personal life stories?  We will explore how historians have engaged in what can be called a writing of the self, with a focus on the second half of the 20th century.

For millennia, this communication took place with our bodies: via gestures, facial expressions, sounds, movements, and eventually, through spoken language. Later, writing and its technologies supplanted earlier forms, creating new opportunities for trust. In this seminar, we will explore the relationship between trust, technologies, and human communication by a) reviewing research from sociology, rhetoric, psychology, and other fields to understand the nature of trust; b) exploring the history of communication technology, from the oral cultures to the first forms of writing to the printing press to the Internet; c) investigating trust, technology, and communication in specific contexts, with a focus on social media and the Internet and key features such as the confirmation bias and the changing nature of expertise.

    "info": "Wildland fire as an agent of renewal, vegetation change, and maintenance has been a critical process in the pine forests of the Upper Great Lakes. The vast pineries, so sought after by settler-colonialists as a commodity evolved over millennia with fire. Fires were both \u2018natural\u2019, ignited by lightning strikes, and fire was applied judiciously by Native American groups to manage landscapes and improve resources. It was an act of reciprocity: carefully tending the land to keep it healthy, while utilizing resources in return. However, the advent of effective fire suppression to protect forests first as a commodity and later for recreational enjoyment has led to substantial changes in forest communities while at the same time erasing an important cultural activity from the landscape. This seminar course explores the deep connections between fire and the emergence of Great Lakes forests, as well as the cultural use of fire as a tool. In this course, we will explore the development of effective fire suppression, the emergence of fortress-ecology/conservation, and the impacts of reduced fire activity on forest resilience. We will also discuss the concept of \u2018wilderness\u2019 and traditional ecological knowledge and the relationship with fire management today, particularly within the framework of a changing climate. This course is meant to merge interdisciplinary topics in ecology, climatology, and geography to explore the important connections between humans and their physical environment in the Upper Great Lakes pine landscapes.

It is also designed to consider as well how a mythic understanding of Leonardo da Vinci was also fashioned from this same historical foundation, turning him into an almost supernatural icon of the universal creative genius. Especially noteworthy in the mythic idea of Leonardo is his seeming transcendence of the imagined \u201cTwo Cultures\u201d divide between the Arts and the Sciences, and his identity as a virtuoso artist in multiple domains simultaneously (painting, scuplture, architecture, and the visual arts overall) a pioneering figure in science, engineering, and the history of technology in fields ranging from anatomy to hydraulics and engineering to physics. How, this course will ask, did each of these aspects of Leonardo\u2019s work come to be a part of his historical life and accomplishments, and how after his death was his fully historical life and work refashioned into our contemporary mythistorical understanding of Leonardo as a singular universal genius and seemingly supernatural \"Renaissance Man\"? \n\nThe course will pursue these topics in three parts. Part I (Weeks 1-7) will be devoted to the historical Leonardo, and during spring break (March 3-12) we pursue Part II by traveling to Italy to experience Leonardo\u2019s Italy as it exists today, and to start connecting the historical life with the imagined legacy of it. In Part III (weeks 12-15), we will consider the invention of the mythistory of Leonardo in the centuries after his death, especially the forging in the modern era (after 1870) of his contemporary identity as a seemingly magical and superhuman creative genius who defies interpretation in ordinary historical terms.  \n",

The results are timeless uses for poetry as Dylan's music redefines how poetry influences and shapes popular culture. The main goal of the course is to come to an understanding of how his unique vision begins within the poetic traditions of the past and, as his songs redefine what poetry is, takes contemporary expression toward new definitions for literature. By the end of the course, the student of Dylan's work should master a body of knowledge and a mode of inquiry in Dylan studies and understand the role of creativity, innovation, discovery, and expression across such disciplines as American literature, folk and rock music, the history of political protest, and the popular artist in society.",

We will ask: What is development and why has it come to saturate common sense as an indispensable given of our modern existence? How should we account for the power of development in the lives of rich and poor nations, and rich and poor people? What role did the idea of development play in how the West has thought about itself in relation to the non-West? Finally, how do emerging economic powers such as China and India, who are now large donors of development aid in Africa and Latin America, imagine development in contrast to their counterparts in the West? In terms of content,  the course will introduce students to, both, the classic literature on development as well latest writings on it.",

    "info": "In the second half of the twentieth century, in the wake of World War II and decolonization, a language of human rights developed that emphasized rights as individual and universal. Many of us now take this particular notion of human rights as a given. In this seminar, we will explore the complicated and multi-faceted history of how societies in different parts of the world have defined what it is to be human, the treatment owed to humans, and various kinds of rights. Some of these philosophies are grounded in religion and others in secularism. Some identify the nation-state as the adjudicator of rights, while others would empower international organizations or grassroots movements. For some, the individual is sacrosanct, while for others, persons are inextricably embedded in social webs. We will study how these concepts have changed over time as the globe has become increasingly interconnected and consider their relevance and application in our contemporary society.\n\nThe semester will be divided into five mini units. In the first, we will explore concepts of the human and of rights in major faith traditions. In the second, we will examine the debates that emerged from European colonialism in the Atlantic world. In the third, we will study the emergences of an explicit language of human rights after World War II. In the fourth, we will look at human rights issues in the United States. And in the final unit, you will pursue your own research and collaborate in small groups to make presentations and facilitate discussion around common themes.",

We will explore the relation between language and food by analyzing actual conversations among people eating a variety of foods. The conversations will be in a variety of languages (including English, Japanese, Chinese, Lao, Kri, Eegimaa, Wolof, Italian, Persian, German, Danish, French, Russian, Swedish, Dutch and Spanish).

    "info": "This honors seminar uses memoirs \"non-fictional life stories narrated in the first person?\" as a lens into the past and, just as importantly, as a way to investigate what counts as \"history\" itself.  The relationship between personal narratives and professionally produced histories is often fraught or confused, even though both can reasonably be understood as forms of creative non-fiction.  Is the memoirist responsible to the historical record in the same way as an historian?  Does the historian know how to assess and appreciate the power of personal memory?  What kinds of memoirs do historians write?  We will examine a range of memoirs that speak variously about historical and emotional truths, about memory and identity and place, about the ability of individual experience to illuminate a broader social and political history.  We will attend to the narrator?s voice and explore how certain kinds of writing enable (even produce) certain kinds of discoveries.  Throughout, we will discuss the gains and the limitations of using personal stories to understand past experience. \n\nA note of clarification: while autobiographies tend to be chronological narratives of most of a person's life (without the ending, of course), memoirs focus more selectively--and often without regard to linear chronology--on crucial moments or themes in the narrator's experience.  This course prioritizes memoirs over autobiographies, and it takes most of its examples from the boom in memoir writing over the last three decades.  It does not offer a history of memoir as a genre. In particular, it features memoirs that go beyond the experiences of an individual narrator to reveal broader social and political contexts.",

It is hypothesized that a failure by humans to change course will put the Earth's inhabitants on track to severe and potentially catastrophic implications. The support for the hypothesis comes from the pioneering work of Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen and others, arguing that all natural resources are irreversibly degraded when put to use in economic activity. Paul Ehrlich, in his bet with Julian Simon, had an opposing perspective that resource depletion may not be a problem for the future of humanity. Others said the following: \"We write with the conviction that knowledge and technology, applied with wisdom, might allow for a good, or even great, Anthropocene.\"\n\nThese statements provide evidence both in support of and against the hypothesis. Students registered for this course will learn resource consumption dynamics and distribution from both perspectives. The information presented in this course will be valuable to the policymakers, stakeholders, and administrators working with human resource consumption. The specific aims are the following:\n(1) Introduce the distribution and regulation of Earth's natural resources.\n(2)\tExplain the human pressures that decouple resource consumption from resource regeneration (in support of the hypothesis). \n(3)\tDiscuss the social aspects of resource consumption in the Anthropocene (against the hypothesis).\n(4)\tWork on Group research projects based on the opposing views of resource consumption.",

In this Honors Seminar, we will explore our personal values, ethics, and social, cultural, and religious aspects of food production and consumption. We will examine some core issues faced by producers, suppliers, and consumers around the world. Questions regarding the relationship of agricultural and ecological processes, roles of individual farmers and agribusiness, religious and cultural considerations, personal choices, and nutritious and satisfying meals will challenge each of us to construct a personal framework around food. \n\nGuest lecturers of different backgrounds and interests will be engaged throughout the course. For example, we will tap into many stakeholders, including but not limited to academics, activists, community leaders, and religious groups who have expertise in food production and consumption.  Soil scientists will explain how rocky soils and steep slopes have challenged Central American agricultural practice. Veterinarians will help us understand how their relationship with the farmers and animals have helped shape their vocation and the surrounding food production systems.  Environmental scientists will explore the implications of modern agriculture on environmental sustainability.  This course adopts interdisciplinary perspectives. Students will read, think about, and discuss materials sourced from disciplines such as environmental science, geography, economics, anthropology, and history. \n\nThis Honors Seminar will help us appreciate the landscapes and ecosystems, human labor, and socio-economic infrastructure needed at the local level to fulfill the task of putting food on the plate and become aware of what occurs at a global scale to feed the world while being both economically and ecologically sustainable. At the completion of the Honors Seminar, each of us should be able to explain that not only is food a nutritional good but also to understand, in a global context, the significant costs and conflicts involved in meeting our needs and desires.

Is climbing sport? Play? Both? What does it take to be a sport? How do we define play? How are these related? Here, we consider C. Thi Nguyen\u2019s recent book Games: Agency as Art and various philosophical works on the philosophy of sport. In this section, we\u2019ll also begin our exploration of disability within climbing, beginning with a lecture from local adaptive climbing professionals.\n\nAs we shift our attention to Wellbeing, we will consider the role of play and movement in a life well lived, the possibility of resistance through joyful activity, and the creation of communities and communal spaces. We\u2019ll also learn about quiet resistance from Prof. Tamara Fakhoury and hear about the creation of movement patterns from setters at our local gym, the Minneapolis Bouldering Project.\n\nFinally, we consider social construction. The development of climbing has brought us from unstructured play in the wilderness to Olympic competition in carefully graded, pristinely crafted problems set with plastic holds on artificial, almost featureless walls. We have created fine-grained rating systems that categorize the difficulty of climbs that purport to provide objective measures, even as we know that they don\u2019t map on to the different bodies and preferences of different climbers. We\u2019ll look at these phenomena through the lens of social construction to understand what they mean and the role they play in our society.",

    "info": "In the wake of the financial crisis of 2008, anti-corporate rhetoric in the U.S. reached a crescendo. Corporations \u2013 especially financial corporations \u2013 were blamed for the crisis and the misery it left in its trail. But this anger was just a spike in a long tradition of distrust and suspicion of corporations. Their legitimacy has always been in question. One of the legacies sf this tradition is the rich lode of epithets applied by Americans to corporations and their bosses including robber barons, trusts, economic royalists, malefactors of great wealth, merchants of death. The portrayal of corporations in popular entertainment \u2013 take Hollywood, for example -- is uniformly negative. The news media\u2019s relations with corporations are predominantly adversarial. Running against corporations is a well-established way of running for elected public office.\nOne of the events that did the most to crystallize public anger was the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Citizens United v. FEC (2010) that \noverturned limits on corporate spending to influence elections to federal office. In that case, a pro-business Court was widely seen as having used an arcane legal doctrine \u2013 about legal personhood -- to hand a victory to corporate interests. Perhaps mistakenly, the issue became defined as whether corporate persons qualified for the same constitutional Free Speech rights as natural persons. A bumper sticker at the time read: \u201cI\u2019ll believe a corporation is a person when the state of Texas executes one.\u201d And presidential candidate Mitt Romney was greeted with derision when he told an audience at the Iowa State Fair that \u201cCorporations are people, my friend.\u201d \u201cOf course they are,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything corporations earn ultimately goes to people. Where do you think it goes?\u201d The case offers an opportunity to examine both the nature of the corporation and the sources of the hostility to it.\nThis Honors seminar will try to solve is \u201cwhy in America?\u201d Why is it that, in probably the most thoroughly capitalist nation in the world, corporations are the most reviled? Of course, that the critics of corporations might answer that that is be precisely the point. Is it because it is in the United States that corporations have been left most free to plunder? The privileges in question are said to have enabled corporations to accumulate wealth. They include (1) limited liability, (2) legal personhood, (3) perpetual life, and (4) the free transferability of interests. You can see where these arguments are leading. If corporations owe their very existence to government and /or if corporations\u2019 wealth is made possible by special privileges, then in return (it can be argued) society has the right to demand that corporations put the public interest ahead of the private interests of its shareholders. \nThis is just a sampling of the controversies that swirl around the corporation. By studying these controversies, you will gain a far deeper and more multilayered understanding of the nature of the corporation and its place in our economy and society. But the debate(s) over the corporation will also shine a light on ourselves \u2013 and our fears and hopes -- by means of our reactions to corporations. ",

The rage against drug companies is bipartisan.

They abuse their government-enforced monopolies to charge extortionate prices that deny some Americans access to treatment for life-threatening illnesses, bankrupt middle-class Americans, and place intolerable strains on state budgets. \n\nThis seminar will use a cure for hepatitis C (Sovaldi) to evaluate the claim that drug companies charge exorbitant prices and (optimistically?) to try to answer the question of what is a just price for a life-saving drug.

Nevertheless, there remain impactful diseases that cannot be controlled by vaccination for a variety of reasons, and global geopolitical factors often complicate public health initiatives.  Further, vaccines have become controversial in some western societies, and debates have raged regarding potential negative aspects of routine vaccinations, scientific misconduct, and individual rights. This course will provide a scientific and historical background on immunity as a prelude to interdisciplinary discussion of vaccines and vaccinations.  Seminars will combine didactic lectures with structured peer-to-peer interactions and debates.  Students will consume both print and electronic media from multiple perspectives in order to reach their own conclusions regarding vaccines and vaccine safety. A final term paper will also inform peers as to various biological, public health, economic, regulatory, or cultural aspect of vaccines.",

    "info": "Despite extensive commercial applications, a clear understanding of the adverse effects of Engineered Nanoparticles (ENPs) is lacking. A survey of the literature indicated the available information to be incomplete, independently unverified, and some may have been over-interpreted. Deep uncertainties currently pervade every step of the risk assessment of ENPs, making the procedure incapable of properly serving its purpose. The current conventional risk assessment strategies are not applicable for ENPs because of their unique properties and toxicity that may not conform to the norms of classic toxicology laws. Therefore, implementing some non-conventional tools in the risk assessment framework may be needed to reduce uncertainties and deliver accurate risk characterization of ENPs. This would enable current regulation to adequately reflect the risks of ENPs and protect the environment and the community. Therefore, the students registered for this seminar will learn some general features of ENPs, how the general public might be exposed to ENPs, and their potential health effects so that they can make an informed decision regarding the safe use of ENPs. With a serious information gap regarding ENPs safety, whether ENPs are a blessing or a curse is debatable. ",

Some of these episodes are well-known, such as the exploitation of poor African American men with syphilis in Tuskegee, Alabama, and the injection of the hepatitis A virus into mentally disabled children at the Willowbrook State School in New York.  But such well-known cases represent only a small fraction of ethically contentious medical research.\n  \nIn the 1960s, for example, at the world-renowned Allen Memorial Institute at McGill University, the CIA paid psychiatric researchers to use mentally ill subjects in \"mind control\" experiments involving LSD, intensive electroconvulsive therapy, and drug-induced comas for up to three months at a time. In 1996, during a meningitis epidemic in Nigeria, researchers for the pharmaceutical company Pfizer conducted a study of an unapproved antibiotic on children without the informed consent of their parents, resulting in eleven deaths. In 2013, two neurosurgeons at the University of California-Davis were forced to resign after authorities discovered that they had intentionally implanted bacteria in the brains of cancer patients. Today, the University of Minnesota itself is under investigation after for the case of Dan Markingson, a mentally ill young man who nearly decapitated himself after allegedly being coerced into an AstraZeneca-funded psychiatric study.\n\nIn this course, we will explore questions such as: What cultural and institutional forces allowed the scandals to occur?  What were the best ethical arguments in favor of allowing the research to proceed?  How were the scandals exposed?  What was the role of investigative reporters, regulatory authorities, and whistleblowers?  Should we have confidence that research abuse is not occurring today?",

Beyond these specific topics, students will select a specific policy issue to delve into on their own, and produce two papers: a short background memo on the nature of the issue and what is known about the facts that may make it an area in need of change, and a policy memo suggesting and advocating for possible changes. During the last three weeks, students will present their policy briefs to the seminar.\n\nThe goal of the course is to understand the factual reality behind some major issues confronting the courts and the challenges of making policy changes to address these issues. Each of the five topics will be dealt with over two sessions of the seminar with the first session examining the issue from a policy perspective and the second session examining the issue from the perspective of differing political interests. Some of the sessions on policy change will involve students in the seminar debating the issue drawing upon the policy discussions from the previous week as well as their own research into the issue; other sessions may involve a guest speaker.

We will explore the nature of the cosmos by first examining the category itself and what is involved in trying to study cosmology comparatively with sensitivity to cultural difference. We will then look at some different understandings of the nature of the cosmos (i.e. cosmologies) offered by different peoples in the past and around the world. We will start with two ancient, non-Western cosmologies: the Sanskrit Hindu and Buddhist traditions and the traditions of the native peoples of North America. We will then examine the history of Western cosmological thinking by looking at Greco-Roman Antiquity, Medieval Christian and Islamic cosmology, and the birth of modern, scientific cosmology in the Scientific Revolution (Galileo, Newton, etc.). Our overall goal will not be to establish a single, absolute, and universal understanding of the cosmos, but, rather, to develop an understanding of the value and power of each of the different cosmologies we will encounter and the consequences that follow from accepting one or the other of them as our point of view.

That's still true today, but the nature of what we call community journalism is changing. For decades, community journalism has been defined by its geographical boundaries, concerning chiefly the institutions - schools, churches, businesses, or government - within those borders. While that traditional community journalism is certainly still alive today, the reach of digital journalism and social media has transformed the notion of community. New communities can define themselves beyond geography, a shift that creates opportunities for journalists to cover a broader sense of \"where\" people live. This course will explore this shift through practical, hands-on experience, and thoughtful consideration of the journalist's role in covering diverse communities. Through readings, lectures and discussions with professionals who do the work, students will consider the notion of community journalism and the best practices for it. Students will target a community in and around the University of Minnesota and develop cover that community on the student-run website AccessU. The goal is for those teams to publish relevant stories about the community on that site in text, photos, video, and visualizations.\n\nprereq: [JOUR 3004 or 3004H], JOUR 3101, [JOUR 3103 or JOUR 3121 or JOUR 3155 or JOUR 3173 or JOUR 4302], Jour major",

You will receive and give peer feedback. In addition to our seminar, you will have the chance to meet with the instructor to talk about your thesis, discuss ideas, research methods, and data analysis plans, and receive feedback on thesis drafts. The regular class meetings and outside meetings with the instructors are meant to hold you accountable to yourself and to the instructor for making progress towards completing a thesis on time.\n\nprereq: Honors, [Jour major, Strat Comm major, or Media and Information major]",

Second, there is a hands-on component - giving students the opportunity to exercise what they learn in this class and elsewhere in their journalism program. This part of the course will require students to identify appropriate stories for in-depth reporting, outline the proposed stories to the instructor, thoroughly report the stories and go through the editing process. Students will also produce graphics and photographs, and might consider various multi-media possibilities. The class topics will be organized around essential social issues, such as health care, politics, poverty, business, or other topics. During some semesters, students will produce news stories for publication at a professional news organization, such as MinnPost.com.

This course provides the biological principles for how the body works, from the function of intracellular organelles to the interactions between systems and the role of each organ. It explains the relationship between structure and function and describes the development of diseases when the physiological systems become impaired. \n\nThis course in human physiology builds on knowledge obtained using the basic sciences of math, chemistry, and physics. Thus, understanding some of these sciences' basic principles is essential to fully understanding the physiological principles during this course. \n\nThe lab component of this course takes place at the Human Performance Teaching Laboratory (HPTL). Lab activities are an interactive component of the course. During labs, students will perform a series of experiments, record data, and will provide a physiological interpretation for the results. \n\nThe combination of lecture material and laboratory experience will allow students to understand disease mechanisms, comprehend the strategies to prevent and treat the most frequent medical conditions, and live a healthy life.

    "info": "Works in political philosophy, whether historical or more contemporary, are one central element of the study of philosophy more broadly. As we will address these works, and the issues and concepts they take up, they fall within the larger field of moral philosophy. Like other works in this broad category, discussion in political philosophy typically consider both metaethical and normative questions. \n\nMetaethical questions concern the concepts we use as we consider matters of right and wrong or of ethical value. In the realm of political philosophy, authors consider rightness, wrongness and ethical value as they bear on political societies and political leaders, and not only on citizens but on non-citizens who experience the effects of political power. Examples of such questions include: What is justice? What is political power? What are freedom, equality and autonomy?\n\nNormative questions, by contrast, concern matters of practice. In the context of moral and political philosophy, they are typically questions about what we must do or refrain from doing if we are to act rightly (as opposed to prudently or efficiently for instance). Examples in the political realm include: What are just standards of criminal punishment? What obligations does a just state have to citizens and to non-citizen residents? What right, if any, do citizens and others have to protest state laws, policies and actions? What rights can citizens or others claim to equality under the law? What grounds or justifies our responses to such questions?\n\nOver the course of this semester, we will read both canonical texts in the history of political philosophy and pieces by a variety of authors who are less well known. Our aim will be to improve our ability to understand broad claims and more nuanced points, to compare and critically assess contrasting views, and to appreciate the ways in which political philosophers often draw or expand on others' works even as they challenge them. We will also be working towards improvements in the difficult task of explaining and supporting claims and analyses, in short written pieces, longer essays and oral discussions. \n\nprereq: 1004 or instr consent",

The course is designed to help students understand what liberal education is by engaging in the study of American politics as a fundamentally critical and creative enterprise, and by grappling with the most complex and challenging problems of political life, such as the sources of political equality and inequality, and the tension between individual aspirations and political control.  Questions of power and choice, opportunity and discrimination, freedom and restrictions on freedom are fundamental to the historical development of and current controversies within the American political system, and we will attend to all of these. \n\nWe will explore topics including the ideas underlying the nation\u2019s founding and its constitutional foundations; civil rights and civil liberties; the role of the United States in an increasingly globalized world; the structure and function of American political institutions; and the behavior of American citizens in the political process. \n\nIn addition, we will learn to think and communicate like political scientists.  We will read primary documents, such as the Federalist papers, engage with scholarly arguments about the way the American political system works, and critically evaluate critiques of the American political system that have been offered from a variety of perspectives. \n\nBy the end of the semester students should have a basic understanding of the structure and function of American government as well as an increased ability to critically reflect on the degree to which our institutions, processes, and citizens live up to the expectations placed on them.  Students will be able to identify, define, and solve problems and to locate and critically evaluate information.  Students will have mastered a body of knowledge and a mode of inquiry.

In this course we examine the earliest attempts to describe Jesus and his significance in the gospel literature of the first and second centuries and beyond. We ask how historians may claim to \"know\" the \"facts\" of Jesus's life and meaning in light of these various portraits. We seek to understand how the different literary presentations of Jesus reflect their authors' social, religious, and political situations. We aim to understand in more detail the diversity of perspectives about Jesus from the earliest stage of the development of Christianity.

The main difference between a regular and an honors 3015 section will not be the quantity of work expected of the students, but rather the quality expected, not only of them but also of the instructor and the instruction provided.\n\nThe course integrates reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills. Classes are conducted in Spanish. When working with a truly committed group of students, as it is assumed honors students will be, the instructor can go more in depth when dealing with difficult Spanish texts or unfamiliar cultural and historical issues. Instead of aiming just for reading comprehension, we will analyze cultural issues and identify literary strategies while working at the same time with highly advanced grammatical structures. Exposing students to different approaches on Latin-American History and Cultures, the instructor will promote discussion and will ask challenging but realistic questions to help students make connections between literary works/essays presented in the textbook or short videos used in class. By understanding, analyzing, and connecting, students will develop not only their linguistic abilities but also their critical thinking and a better understanding of the Hispanic world, and, therefore, they will be able to reconsider their own ideas and form new ones. All that work and growth will fully prepare them for the Literature, Culture or Linguistic classes (31xx courses) they will take once they finish Spanish 3015V if they choose to continue with their Spanish Studies.\n\nThe same criteria apply to the writing component of the course. In an honors class we will not simply try to avoid mistakes when writing a composition. Instead, students will be working on stretching their level farther by incorporating the grammatical structures learned through the readings and grammar lessons taught in class, and they will be required to explain their ideas better and in a more advanced way. Again, the number of compositions required will be the same as in a regular section, but the quality expected will be higher, and they will receive high quality feedback from their Instructor: More advanced, higher quality writing is acquired only when the efforts of committed students are paired with the careful guidance and expertise of an also committed and experienced instructor.\n\nWhen during the last weeks of the semester honors students read and work on the Spanish novel all the 3015 students in our Department are required to read, they will be ready to fully understand it, look for literary strategies, relate to some cultural and moral issues, and discuss difficult topics with confidence: Throughout the semester they will have practiced a solid work ethic and acquired a wider understanding of themselves and the world around them, and, now, with the help of their Instructor, they will be able to fully appreciate the lessons and proposals the novel Mos\u00e9n Mill\u00e1n by Ram\u00f3n Sender has to offer. By the end of the course, students will have developed their critical thinking and improved their language abilities, and they will be more compassionate. They will also be fully ready to take more advanced Spanish classes if they decide to do so.\n\nprereq: SPAN LPE pass, Honors student",

Beginning in 1492, the Catholic Monarchs, Isabel, and Fernando consolidated Spanish power over the other kingdoms in Iberia, expelled the Jews, and began the conquest of the so-called \u201cNew World.\u201d The following years saw an influx and their kingdom became globally influential, eventually becoming a world empire. But, for whom was this a \u201cGolden Age\u201d? In this class we will explore the historical, political, and social trends that shaped what it meant to be \u201cSpanish\u201d and the territory thought of as \u201cSpain.\u201d The definition of \u201cSpanish\u201d was created in apposition to various Others\u2014the various people and groups that were relegated to the lower echelons of the social hierarchy. Religion played an important role in the shaping of this identity.\n\nWe will apply contemporary theories\u2014such as those around forms of racism, classism, Othering\u2014from the field of cultural studies to cultural and historical developments within the Spanish Golden Age. For example, being \u201cSpanish\u201d was based in the idea of \u201cCristianos viejos\u201d/Old Christians (who had no trace of Muslim or Christian blood in their family lines). We will explore other peoples and groups in Spain/Iberia and their contributions to what would become the Spanish nation. Among the themes studied in class:\n\n\u2014rhetoric of difference, including the limpieza de sangre or notions of blood purity\n\u2014gender: what did it mean to be espa\u00f1ola?\n\u2014the Spanish colonies in the Americas and the people who lived there\n\u2014systems of power: Old Christians, nobility and conquerors\n\u2014the institutionalization of \u201cSpain\u201d\n\u2014the subversive concept of the Baroque: Miguel de Cervantes against the \u201cState\u201d\n\nprereq: A grade of C- or better in SPAN 3104W or SPAN 3104V or TLDO 3104W or ARGN 3104W or SPAN 3105W or SPAN 3105V or TLDO 3105W or SPAN 3107W or SPAN 3107V or TLDO 3107W",

The selected materials are essential documents of their times, and often influential statements about the history, identity, and culture of the region. Through a close examination of essays, novels, short stories, poems, and other texts students can appreciate their cultural legacy and understand the socio-historical context and the intellectual forces that shaped Modern Latin America. Concentration will center on the textual strategies, topics, world views, motivations, projects, and expectations explicit or implicit in the texts, their significance at the time, and their importance for understanding the formation of what we know as Latin America today. The course also examines Modern Latin America by analyzing the role of political discourse and the legacies of colonialism in the region. With literary texts and documents, students will deal with different theoretical approaches deriving from the humanities and the social sciences. Such interdisciplinary method will provide the tools, concepts, and strategic visions to carry on analytical tasks in class. All the work for the course, except for certain supplementary readings, will be in Spanish. Requirements will include preparation of assigned readings, presentation of analytical and comprehensive tasks, class discussions, and a research project. The course provides training in analytical thinking and cultural critique of Modern Latin America, bringing a global perspective to our curriculum.\n\nprereq: A grade of C- or better in SPAN 3104W or SPAN 3104V or TLDO 3104W or ARGN 3104W or SPAN 3105W or SPAN 3105V or TLDO 3105W or SPAN 3107W or SPAN 3107V or TLDO 3107W",

    "info": "This course constitutes an introduction to the origins and history of the Spanish language. Spanish (or Castilian) descends from Latin, which is also the ancestor of Portuguese, Italian, French, Romanian, among others. This is why we say bueno in Spanish, bon in French, buono in Italian, bom in Portuguese, and buna in Romanian. Also, Latin belongs to a wider group of languages: the Indo-European family, which also includes Sanskrit, English, German, and Russian, among others. For this reason, the word for the number two in English is similar to dos in Spanish, dva\u00fa in Sanscript, dva in Russian and zwei in German. \n\nIn the course, we will see how Latin words changed to become Spanish words. These changes did not happen in a void. Therefore, in the first part of the course we will study the historical circumstances that caused the birth and expansion of Spanish. When Romans invaded the Iberian Peninsula there were other groups already there who lent some of their words to Latin. Celts occupied the northwestern portion of Spain, which is known as Galicia. Interestingly, the traditional musical instrument of Galicia is the bagpipe, as in Ireland and Scotland, which also have Celtic ancestors. Some Celtic words passed to the variety of Latin spoken in the Iberian Peninsula, and later to Spanish. Thus, while France and Italy utilize the Germanic word bier to designate beer: French bi\u00e8re, Italian birra, in Spanish we say cerveza, which comes from the Celtic word cerevisia. With the fall of the Roman Empire, Germanic tribes invaded the Iberian Peninsula. This is how some Germanic terms passed to Latin and eventually became Spanish. Since English is a Germanic language, these Spanish terms are similar to the English ones: spy esp\u00eda, vandalism vandalismo, goose, ganso, etc. At the end of the Germanic rule, Arab groups invaded Iberia. As a result, Spanish has more than four thousand Arabic words, as ojal\u00e1 from inshallah \u2018god willing\u2019. The Arabs brought with them advances in astronomy, mathematics, medicine, agriculture, poetry, etc. For this reason, during the Middle Age, Al-Andal\u00fas, which was the name of the territory of the Iberian Peninsula occupied by the Arabs, flourished economically and culturally. It is during this period that Spanish developed. \n\nIn the second part of the course, we will see how Latin words transformed into Spanish. These changes were not at random, on the contrary most of them changed in predictable ways. For example, the Latin letter p when placed between two vowels became b in Spanish: the word lupus \u2018wolf\u2019 became lobo in Spanish, scopa \u2018broom\u2019 became escoba. Studying this evolution will help you understand the reason behind some supposed irregularities in the Spanish Grammar: duermo vs. dormimos. Also, you will be able to recognize the relation between some English and Spanish words, since both languages are like lone cousins.\n\nprereq: A grade of C- or better in SPAN 3104W or SPAN 3104V or TLDO 3104W or ARGN 3104W or SPAN 3105W or SPAN 3105V or TLDO 3105W or SPAN 3107W or SPAN 3107V or TLDO 3107W.",

You will learn how Spanish speakers deal with requests, refusals, compliments, advice, and apologies, and how they accommodate their discourse to their interlocutors. You will also explore how courtesy and discourtesy are expressed and inferred by Spanish speakers and how Spanish is utilized to persuade the audience, thus bringing up issues of language and power. Finally, you will study how members of Hispanic culture express themselves by non-verbal means (gestures, body movements, etc.). In sum, you will be exposed to the sociocultural resources native speakers utilize to infer and convey meaning. In class, after learning the theory, you will work in groups analyzing real cases of oral and written communicative exchanges in Spanish.

In what ways is the process similar to or different from first language acquisition? In what ways are heritage learners similar to or different from second language learners? What level of proficiency do most Spanish majors attain by the time they graduate? What strategies can language learners use to reach higher levels of proficiency?\n \nThe second part of the course will focus on the aspects of Spanish that are especially challenging for both second language learners and heritage speakers. For example, we\u2019ll analyze why the distinction between the preterite and imperfect past tenses is so difficult for English-speakers to acquire. We\u2019ll also examine pragmatic differences in the way people interact in Spanish and English. For example, is making a request in a restaurant done the same way in Minneapolis as in Madrid, Spain or Quito, Ecuador? How do English speakers learn to make appropriate requests in Spanish?

Rather, translation will provide an opportunity to think about the factors we need to take into consideration when making the large number of decisions we need to make when using the Spanish language. Throughout the course a variety of types of texts will be examined that vary in terms of style, audience and lexicon, and these will serve as a framework for learning to make decisions that accurately communicate our intended meaning in Spanish. In doing so, we will review many points of Spanish grammar and learn to think about them in new ways \u2013 from the most basic grammar points that students think they understand well but perhaps haven\u2019t realized that there are subtle differences from English to those grammar points that always pose challenges for even the most advanced students.

Through exciting examples of plays and productions from around the world, we investigate the history, politics, and aesthetics of theatre. We explore how the different components of theatre (from directing to acting, costume, and lighting design) come together to create powerful impact on stage. We read and discuss plays in class, see performances on stage, and hear from some of the Twin Cities\u2019s most dynamic and committed artists. And we work on valuable writing skills that help us to deepen our understanding of theatre and communicate our insights to others. At the end of the class, we bring together everything we have been learning to make theatre in small groups. No previous theatre experience is needed. \n\nPrereq: Honors student",

Based on the assumption that writing is a social activity, the course is a workshop format and requires active engagement in the writing process, including pre-writing, peer review, revision, and editing. Students develop information literacy and hone the ability to locate, evaluate, and effectively and ethically incorporate information into their own texts. In the honors section of WRIT 1301, students will meet the same course outcomes with a deepened focus on and attention to writing processes and rhetorical strategies that are attuned to students' academic, scholarly, and professional goals. As part of this honors experience, students will produce a research proposal relevant and responsive to their intended field of study. The writing and research processes that students engage in to compose the proposal will be navigated, facilitated, and guided by frequent interactions with and feedback from peers and the instructor, and by regularly embedded metacognitive practice. The course will emphasize student-driven topic selection and inquiry development, peer-to-peer interactions, and metacognition so as to support a deep experience with and development of capacity in collaboration and in the iterative writing and research processes.
