This project uses NextJS' [App
Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing), which
uses the file/directory hierarchy to determine the page and API routes.
`(home)` holds the home page and directories corresponding to other page
routes.

<!-- TODO all page route files should have .tsx extension -->
<!-- TODO all API route files should have .ts extension -->
