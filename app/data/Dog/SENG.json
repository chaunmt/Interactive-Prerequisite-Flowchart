In this course, using cloud computing as a lens, we will explore the broader impact of technology change. We discuss how a technology radar can help a technologist stay marketable as well as to help an organization stay informed of important changes in the technology landscape. Expected topics: Docker; Kubernetes; Google Kubernetes Engine, Amazon EKS, Amazon Fargate; Cloud Foundry; Functions as a service; Amazon Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure.
