accessibility through e-commerce, but there has been little philosophical work on the ethical issues surrounding these. this course is designed to encourage students to critically examine and reflect on these factors as well as dietary supplement use across cultures and the appropriation of traditional medicines and knowledge for commercial gains. students will also evaluate information on dietary
