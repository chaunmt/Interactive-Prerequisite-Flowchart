As a result, Queer directors and writers sometimes speak in a liberatory way to particular oppressed/silenced groups on the level of coded content, but if the content is consumed out of context of the code, the experience of a film may be contradictory, even offensive. Consequently, we'll be looking for the queer subversions within the distortions.",

    "info": "The 2015 College Student Health Survey, administered by Boynton Health at the University of Minnesota found that there has been an increase in the number of women and men who reported they have been a victim/survivor of sexual assault. Approximately one in three (32.4%) female students at the University of Minnesota–Twin Cities report experiencing a sexual assault within their lifetime, with 8.9% reporting having been assaulted within the past 12 months. This is an increase over previous surveys, including a 2013 survey in which 22 percent reported sexual assault in their lifetime. Male students at the college have experienced sexual assault at lower rates, with 10.7% reporting an assault within their lifetime and 2.7% reporting an assault within the past 12 months. Recently released research (Eisenberg, Lust, Mathiason & Porta, 2017) based on this very same annual surveillance program has found that rates of sexual assault victimization were considerably higher among LGBTQ students than heterosexual students.  \nThis interactive seminar asks and attempts to answer: what would it take to end sexual violence for everyone at the University of Minnesota? We will explore this question in the feminist criminology, public health, and anti-sexual violence movement literatures.  In addition, we will learn from guest speakers—student activists, sexual assault advocates, Title IX coordinators, researchers, Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners, transformative justice collective members, etc.—who are working tirelessly both on- and off-campus to end both sexual violence and the “rape culture” that sustains it.

One of the basic premises of this course is that psychosocial wounds of white body supremacy in the  United States impedes ethical reasoning and decision making in society. Consequently, most Americans routinely reinforce the power of whiteness and white supremacy to detriment of other members of society, the social environments that people interact in, and society as a whole. This course will educate students about the socio-cultural wounds of racial trauma in the United States, toward the aim of, building personal and interpersonal resilience at school, work, and other settings. Students will develop skills to recognize and disrupt white body supremacy in order to foster racial justice, equity, and diversity in broader society.\n",

    "title": "Inequality & American Dream",
    "info": "Increasing and intensifying inequality is perhaps the most pressing socio-economic problem of our time. A significant threat to democracy, the American dream, and national values of diversity and inclusion, wealth inequality today has not only surpassed that of the Great Depression but also grafted onto longstanding, intersectional cleavages of race, gender, indigeneity, class, and sexuality. The richest one percent have captured nearly 60 percent of all income gains from 1977 to 2000, and in 2010, the top 20 percent of households owned almost 90 percent of all privately held wealth in the United States, while the net worth of the bottom 40 percent was negative. Simultaneously, much of the current political polarization, cultures of resentment, and rise in scapegoating and racist anti-immigrant actions have also been attributed to the attendant consequences of rising inequality, anxiety, and insecurity. \n\nAnd yet, many social critics argue that instead of addressing the key causes of inequality and the crisis of the American dream, the powerful in society have seized on these conditions to mobilize an avalanche of discontent among sectors of the downwardly mobile in a way that often obscures the key reasons for their predicament and scapegoats those at the social margins. Given this context, it is imperative to better understand and analyze the histories, cultural assumptions, and hierarchies that have produced contemporary inequality. How did we get to this point? What are the consequences, and what might we expect in the future? This set of seminars asks these hard questions and engages in precisely this exploration.  \n\nThese four freshman seminars (AFRO 1917, ANTH 1917, GWSS 1917, HIST 1917) will occasionally meet together, and will bring together scholars across multiple disciplines (African American Studies, Anthropology, Feminist Studies, History, and beyond) who are substantively engaged with scholarship on class, race, indigeneity, gender, and sexuality. We believe that this cross-fertilization is critical because the fault-lines of inequality have precisely cohered to these structural formations and categories of analysis.\n",

Feminist approaches explore dis/ability as a vector of oppression intersecting and constituted through race, class, gender, sexuality, and citizenship. The course examines ideologies of ableism and the material realities of such oppression, and works toward imagining and constructing a more just and equitable society. As health care is differentially distributed or limited for people who are sickened by COVID-19, we see that systems of social and economic power determine the life chances of those who claim, or are claimed by disability. Meanwhile, people with disabilities have developed many daily life strategies that can be models for everyone coping with the pandemic.",

    "info": "We often think of reproduction solely in terms of physiological events like pregnancy, delivery, or menstruation that occur in (or to) individual female bodies. Additionally, physicians and demographers appear to be the primary professional experts when it comes to managing and quantifying such reproductive events.  In contrast, this class grapples with reproduction as a social and biological set of meanings and processes through which racial, gender, sexual, and socio-economic inequalities have been amplified, reconfigured, and contested across time and space. We trace how control over reproduction has been critical to a variety of professional, economic and political endeavors, including the rise and consolidation of disciplines like obstetrics-gynecology and demography; the maintenance of white privilege in colonial spaces and the metropole; post-World War II techno-scientific projects of \\\"development\\\" in the global South; and the emergence of the welfare state. The course identifies inequalities along the lines of race, class, gender, sexuality, and nationality in reproductive experiences and outcomes in a wide range of countries, including Cameroon, China, Cuba, Sudan, Soviet Russia, Romania, Zimbabwe, India, Senegal, Burkina Faso, South Africa, Nigeria, and the US. We locate individually embodied reproductive meanings and practices related to pregnancy, delivery, abortion, post-abortion care, contraception, sterilization, surrogacy, and child care in regional, national and global political economies. In other words, we investigate continuities and disruptions in reproductive politics between the individual body and the social body; the past, present and future; and local and global arenas. By exploring how reproduction operates domestically and globally as a mechanism of governance and social and economic stratification, we also consider possibilities for reproductive justice. ",

    "info": "For most of us, stories seem to simply 'happen.' We listen to stories, we tell stories, we are moved by stories, and we retell stories. However, every act of telling stories involves making decisions or moves, and each re-telling of a familiar story may either give birth to new meanings, nuances, and affects, or, it may erase their possibility. Thus, each storyteller can be seen as a translator of stories with a responsibility to retell stories ethically. It is precisely through these translational acts that all politics become politics of storytelling. In this course, we will consider the ways in which the politics of the global and the intimate derive their meanings, effects, and affects from the circulation, transaction, and re-tellings of stories within and across borders.  We will ask how a praxis of ethical engagement with politics can be imagined as a praxis of receiving and retelling stories. By immersing ourselves in the process of remembering, telling, listening, trimming, interweaving, distilling, and performing stories, we will consider how ethical receiving and retelling of stories involves continuous revising, repositioning, and re-theorizing of such vexed and entangled terrains and terminologies as identity, community, rights, and justice, as well as the contingent meanings of knowledge, truth, and ethics.\n\nThis course engages this terrain through a mode of active learning in which all the participants will read and reflect, listen and discuss, tell and retell, watch and play, move and perform collectively. By becoming aware of the ways in which our minds-bodies-souls are inserted in the receiving and translation of stories, we will grapple together with the ways in which our bodies--as our embodiments--help to relationally shape not only our own performances but also our responses to the performances of other living and moving bodies around us. \n\nWe will learn from writings, film, songs, and plays by writers, artists, activists, and thinkers from a range of historical and contemporary locations and struggles. These include: Marie Lily Cerat, W. E. B. Du Bois, Suheir Hammad, Sterlin Harjo, Naeem Inayatullah, June Jordan, AnaLouise Keating, Kauanui, J. Kehaulani, Audre Lorde, Viet Thanh Nguyen, Middle East Research and Information Project, Alok Rai, Nina Simone, Leanne Betasamosake Simpson, Sangtin Writers, Standing Rock Collective, Eve Tuck, Patrick Wolfe, and K. Wayne Yang. Many of the 'Acts' in this course will be co-facilitated with local or international artists and writers.   \n\nThere are no prerequisites for this course. We invite people from all kinds of locations and journeys to join us in this collective exploration. For further information, email: nagar@umn.edu.\n\nGrading Basis: A/F. The course requires all the participants to do sustained work and deep reflections, enjoy the process of imagining and creating with peers in a non-competitive environment.",

We will explore the intricate web of gender and family power relations, and how these are contested and negotiated in these societies.

In this course, we'll examine this history to better understand our contemporary present. We'll analyze constructions of disability and sexuality as they are interwoven with gender, class, race, and citizenship. We will ask: What might it mean to desire disability? Is there a disability sexual culture? Do disabled people queer sex, or does sexuality queer disability? What is the relationship between GLBTQ and disability rights and liberation movements? Drawing from feminist, queer, and disability studies, we'll answer these questions (and more) by examining how the imagined able-bodymind structures our understanding of gender/sexuality, and how disability sexual cultures resist these norms.

Body modification can also represent cultural and subcultural identifications or expectations based on gender, race, class, and sexuality. But what we do with our bodies is never separate from the politics of cultural difference and fluctuating ideas of what is acceptable or unacceptable, civilized or uncivilized. These ideas are historically and culturally specific. This course looks at body modification on a transnational scale to ask how we come to know what differentiates \\\"mutilation\\\" from \\\"correction.\\\" We ask how feminist, queer, and critical race theories illuminate these debates, reading across historical, anthropological, medical and literary texts. Weekly topics include gender, race and cosmetic surgery; skin whitening technologies; transnational gender reassignment; surgical tourism; female genital cutting; piercing, tattooing and scarification; the cultural politics of hair; and body modification in the context of transnational feminized labor.",
