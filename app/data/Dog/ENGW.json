We will start by looking at the building blocks of good imaginative writing: image, voice, character, setting, story, and revision. We will then move on to a more in-depth examination of three forms: literary nonfiction, fiction, and poetry. Students will learn how to read as writers, obtain an understanding and appreciation for imaginative writing, and gain a sense of themselves as creative writers. We will be trying many exercises and assignments, from brainstorming experiments to final drafts, so come ready to write.\n\nprereq: Students may not audit this course",

    "info": "This freshman seminar/writing class, which satisfies the Writing-Intensive requirement, focuses on travel writing, with spring break dedicated to an immersion experience in Toledo, a small medieval city in the center of Spain which has been declared, in its entirety, a national monument.  For centuries an historic, scholarly, and artistic center, Toledo was long famed for its religious tolerance, with Christian, Jewish, and Muslim populations coexisting within its walls. Class will begin in Minnesota with writing experiments, readings, and discussions: why do we travel and what do we gain from a journey into the unfamiliar? How have travelers past and present reacted to cultures and environments not their own? In preparation for spring break in Spain, students will respond to a variety of writing prompts and assignments: the travel memory, the food review, the creative tour guide, the work of ekphrasis, the annotated map, etc. Then, on arrival in Toledo, students will wander through tangled streets, cathedrals, fortresses, synagogues, and museums, keeping a detailed travel journal and taking notes for a final essay as they go. We'll benefit from guided tours of Spanish monuments and museums and take day trips to Madrid and to Segovia. Writing and revising will be emphasized throughout the semester as modes of discovery. No knowledge of Spanish is required for this class.",

    "info": "In this Freshman Seminar, which meets both LE theme and WI requirements, we will explore writing about science and nature in a variety of forms, from field journals and science interpretation to audio/video essays, profiles, and creative works inspired by the natural world. These varied writing assignments will allow students to develop the core writing skills of brainstorming, drafting, and revising as well as communicating ideas in different modes for different audiences. Useful for writers, science students, and those engaged with environment issues, and curious adventurers, the class begins after spring break and extends into May with a two-week immersion experience in New Zealand.An island nation of fiords and volcanoes that has followed a unique evolutionary path, New Zealand is the ideal place to read and write about the natural world. Populated by flightless birds and outsize insects, it has no native land mammals except bats. The country, also called Aotearoa, \"The Land of the Long White Cloud,\" is at the forefront of many scientific debates and challenges, including evolution on islands, the impacts and control of native species, climate change, and reintroduction biology. We will explore Wellington, the capital city, as well as Dunedin, the \"Wildlife Capital of New Zealand,\" a city rich in Maori and Scottish heritage, Victorian architecture, and literary tradition. We will meet with scientists and conservationists working on issues that face both New Zealand and the entire planet. In addition, we will take trips to Matui/Somes Island, a predator-free scientific reserve, the Museum of New Zealand (Te Papa Tongarewa), and the Otago Peninsula, home of colonies of little blue penguins and royal albatross.",

    "title": "Creative Writing in Spain",
    "info": "This undergraduate creative writing class which satisfies both the LE and the Writing-Intensive requirements focuses on the experience and the literary evocation of travel, with students based first in the capital, Madrid, and then in Toledo, a medieval city in the center of Spain. In Madrid, students will write about the Spanish tradition of eating twelve grapes at the stroke of midnight on New Year's eve; they will compare the characteristics of two different plazas; they will write poetry about art in the Prado Museum. In Toledo, they will wander through tangled streets, shops, cathedrals, fortresses, synagogues and museums, taking notes for poems, stories, and essays as they go. Madrid is a vibrant, modern European center; Toledo, a beautifully preserved city on a hill, has been declared, in its entirety, a national monument. For centuries an historic, scholarly and artistic center, Toledo was long famed for its religious tolerance, with Christian, Jewish, and Muslim populations coexisting within its walls. \n\nIn both locations, we will have guided tours of Spanish monuments and museums, and students will reflect on the experience of travel via many different types and styles of writing assignments: the daily post-card, the food review, the creative travel guide, the work of ekphrasis, the annotated map, the daily journal, etc.  Why do we travel and what do we gain from visiting cultures and environments that may be unfamiliar? Writing and revising will be emphasized as creative ways of reflecting on the phenomenon of departure and return.\n\n",

    "title": "Capstone in Creative Writing",
    "info": "This course is devoted to the writing of the senior paper in creative writing. To graduate with a BA in English, students with an interest in creative writing may choose to produce a substantial manuscript of poetry, literary fiction, or literary nonfiction rather than an extended, scholarly essay. In this advanced creative writing workshop, students receive instruction on writing this manuscript from tenured and tenure-track faculty in English. Class sessions typically include in-class writing exercises, which are then expanded into more finished works of poetry or prose reviewed by the faculty and discussed in workshops by the students themselves. Writing exercises and assignments lead, at the end of the semester, to a finished, thoroughly revised manuscript of at least 2,500 words. Faculty teach students to produce a significant body of poetry, fiction, or creative nonfiction though discussions of method, craft, and development; instruction in specific writing techniques; workshopping and revising drafts; solving problems; and creating a coherent and elegant final product. While the subjects about which students write vary depending on student interest and faculty expertise, at least 50 percent of the course grade is determined by students’ writing performance. The seminar also functions as a capstone experience that fulfills many of the Student Learning Outcomes for the English major and the capstone course for those who are pursuing a Minor in Creative Writing. \n\nPrerequisites for Admission: (1) English major status and completion of a Critical Theories and Methods course (ENGL 3001W, ENGL 3002, ENGL 4003) or approved transfer course with a minimum grade of C-minus; (2) completion of at least six credits of creative writing courses, including one intermediate (ENGW 3xxx-level) or advanced creative writing workshop, preferably in the genre of the ENGW 3885W workshop to which you are applying; and (3) submission of a creative writing sample. Admission is by permission of the instructor. Priority will be given to students with senior status who have completed the majority of the major requirements, as well as to students who plan to graduate in the term they are requesting to take the capstone seminar.

    "info": "This course combines a survey course with close readings to help students become more informed readers of key writers who have shaped long form journalism's traditions in Britain and the United States. Most of the course will focus on the 20th century, although we will consider key innovations from the 18th and 19th centuries; students will apply what they learn to a final project that examines a 21st century writer’s texts and contexts. The works in this course focus on what some have called “literary journalism,” which uses the tools of fiction—character and scenes, tropes, and varying points of view—to tell stories that are reported and true (in other words, that are verified and not invented). To understand the power of this work, and the dilemmas it presents, we’ll consider its common origin in both journalism and the novel in the 18th century and track its development through British and American writers as they told ground-level stories about London's poor, America's 19th century urban overcrowding, city streets, the inhumanity of nuclear war, the vulnerability of celebrities, political identity, the depths of artistic self-doubt, drug subcultures of the sixties, the geological fate of huge metropolitan areas and the racism at the heart of American life during civil rights era. We'll also ask critical questions about the conventions and ethics of doing this work, considering the sometimes-compromising role of journalist-confidant as well as the privilege of powerful publishing platforms to exclude diverse voices. By understanding how so-called literary journalism has endured or evolved, students are better able to appreciate the contributions of longform journalists today as they navigate the truths and fictions of today.",
