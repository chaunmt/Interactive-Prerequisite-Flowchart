    "info": "journalism isn't fiction. yet the relationship between what is true and what is artfully constructed toward a \\\"larger truth\\\" -- beyond the facts -- has a complex and intriguing history. this writing-intensive course explores that relationship through close readings of some the best writers of long-form nonfiction, starting with the birth of the novel from journalistic roots in the 18th century and ending with postmodern forms that challenge the notion of what we can ever know. discover the literary devices used by stephen crane's reported street scenes or nellie bly's first-hand investigations into conditions for the mentally ill in the 19th century, and, later, truman capote's nonfiction novel about a kansas farm family's murder. readings include works by pivotal 20th-century writers such as john hersey, joseph mitchell, lillian ross, michael herr, norman mailer, gay talese, joan didion, tom wolfe, and hunter s. thompson, and will trace how their pioneering methods influenced contemporary journalism as well as the documentary films of errol morris and contemporary nonfiction writers expanding into new forms.",
