Historically, there has been a dichotomy between disciplines that identify the abstract principles of the social world we live in and the biology of the organ (i.e., the central nervous system) we use to identify and coordinate those abstract principles as we function in our daily lives. By merging these disciplines and studying our interactions with the world on many layers of analysis, from genes to social dynamics, we can develop a richer understanding of who we are as people.",

Written output of the course must be revised during the semester and a schedule for writing, assessment, and revision needs to be in place at the beginning of the semester. The project needs to be explained in the campus Directed Research contract and the project and participation in the writing support course agreed on by both the student and faculty mentor. The contract must be approved by the Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUGS) for the major before the student is allowed to register. The contract includes a description of learning objectives for the course, agreement about how writing instruction will take place, confirmation of understanding of the timeline for when student writing will be handed in and how it will be assessed, methodology to be used by the student, and how assessment of learning will be conducted by the mentor. Additional oversight is established for this course - near the end of the semester the written output is submitted to the DUGS for the major. The DUGS is responsible to determine that the writing meets standards set by the CBS Education Policy Committee for quality of writing, appropriate citation of literature, well-constructed figures, tables, and legends (if present), appropriate use and interpretation of statistics (if present), conclusions that are supported by evidence, and well-formatted references.

Topics are chosen with a focus on current areas of active research, as well as problems that have driven the field over the past twenty years. The class will combine lectures with discussions of important systems neuroscience papers, and will move at a fast pace. It is intended for graduate students and ambitious undergraduates.",
    "prereqInfo": "One major difference between this course and other math and statistics courses is the focus on systems neuroscience. Our examples will come from the Systems Neuroscience field. Our research priorities will come from Systems Neuroscience and our Friday paper discussions will draw exclusively from scholarly papers in Systems Neuroscience. \n",
