skills, rather than to train \\\"data analytics specialists\\\" (although this class is a good jumping-off point for students who wish to pursue a career specializing in data analytics!). prior coding experience is thus not required, although students should have completed business statistics (sco 2550 or ba 2551 or equivalent statistics course). \n\nafter a general overview of data analytics and machine learning, we will dive into the etl (extract, transform, load) process, covering topics and showcasing applications such as data joins, variable types, formulas, and regular expressions. we will then explore data visualization tools (including pivot tables and dashboards) and conclude the term by modeling data to create business insights via predictions. students will gain hands-on experience using state-of-the-art data analytics tools and will learn how to conduct basic sql queries. students will improve their quantitative and problem-solving skills and learn how to apply scientific research methods to answer questions, present solutions, and discuss limitations. an emphasis will be placed on financial reporting datasets/applications, although the methods and concepts covered are applicable to other business settings/functions. ultimately, students will enhance their analytical skills and achieve a deeper understanding of issues related to financial reporting
