        "info": "The course is designed for college students who are approaching the study of the Italian language for the first time. Lessons are held exclusively in Italian and take into consideration the need to combine the study of lexis and grammar with the development of communication skills and cultural awareness. The instructor encourages students to put the language structures and vocabulary studied in class into practice in real-life situations, thus accelerating the learning process and bringing students into contact with local society so that they may fully appreciate the way of life and cultural differences. This knowledge is an integral part of linguistic competence. ",

        "info": "Physical making remains central to how we understand and design the world around us, even as we become a more digitally connected, global world. These project-based, making-intensive courses celebrate the act and craft of individual hand-making in community with other makers. The specific theme and project change each year and are determined by the expert instructors in consultation with MADE Academy leadership. They are taught by international designers at the MADE Academy, at the Academy of Fine Arts in Syracuse, Italy.\n \nStudents in these workshops will learn in the tradition of the expert and apprentice, working side by side with peers and expert art and design instructors from around the world. Each workshop will focus on a single team project; the prompt is issued at the start of the week, students work through the design and making throughout the week, and the project is reviewed five days later. At mid-week, students have a brief, independent assignment that extends the specific ideas of the workshop in the context of the learning abroad experience and the concurrent summer MADE Academy symposium content.",

        "info": "This course is offered to undergraduate students interested in furthering their knowledge on migration, asylum, and human rights in Europe and in the Mediterranean. The course engages students through an interactive learning approach which takes place in Sicily, as one of the most crucial locations to directly observe, live, and experience migration challenges in the Mediterranean, as well as get the real sense of what managing migration “crises” practically means.\n\nLocated in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Sicily in recent years has become a critical southern borderland at the crossroad of migratory flows and one of the main gateways to Italy and the European Union (EU). While Italy is among the EU Member States that received the highest number of sea arrivals, within Italy Sicily was the major disembarkation location, accounting for 68% of the total number of sea arrivals in the country between 2014 and 2018. By receiving a large flow of people on the move, Sicily stands out as a crucial venue where to interact and engage with contemporary migration challenges and narratives. It offers the opportunity to study the many aspects of migration in Europe and in the Mediterranean in terms of politics, policies, and polity and in terms of the convoluted interaction among different narratives, discourses and actors (migrants and civil society’s voices, politicians, border guards, sea rescuers, human smugglers, media, etc.). Moreover, it allows comparative reflections with other critical southern borders.\n",

        "title": "Entrprnrshp. in Southern Italy",
        "info": "Building a new business is a difficult endeavor anywhere in the world; tenacity, creativity, and endless intrinsic motivation are needed to drive the entrepreneurial spirit. Successful entrepreneurship also requires government and institutional support, infrastructure, and investment. This is clear in the development of “hubs” —tech, finance, AI, etc.—in urban centers around the globe. Such factors create business ecosystems where new entrants to a specific field can thrive. This is also true in Italy.\n\nAs one of the world’s most industrialized economies, Italy has important manufacturing, finance, and agricultural hubs that foster entrepreneurial growth. However, in Southern Italy, the obstacles to entrepreneurship are outsized in comparison to Northern Italy. Poor infrastructure, low cooperation, and a lack of entrepreneurial education have helped to perpetuate the slow development of the South. Young people often move north or abroad to study and work. This phenomenon, oftentimes dubbed the “brain drain,” can also be seen replicated in other highly industrialized countries, where capital, knowledge, and labor end up concentrating in specific geographical areas creating social divides. Nonetheless, entrepreneurship in Southern Italy is growing. In recent years, over 50% of new small businesses registered in Italy were concentrated in the South and Island regions of the country. Thanks to focused national and regional funding initiatives and collective advocacy movements for business development in Southern Italy, new companies have been able to take root. \n",

        "info": "Ethics and integrity in supply chain management (SCM) are continually coming into question as global discussions of fair trade, labor practices, and corruption are more frequently exposed to be connected to business-as-usual practices. Sicily can be viewed as a microcosm of global supply chain challenges and as a laboratory for ethical business practices. From international labor market competition and inequality to the logistics of operating from an island and the implications of corruption and organized crime, businesses of all scales find themselves benefitting from the island’s geopolitical integration in the European Union but also struggling with poor infrastructure, transnational competition, complex transportation logistics, and shifting cultural beliefs. \n\nThis course focuses on the language and tools of sustainability and responsibility as new standard currencies in business and challenges students to consider complex issues of ethics and integrity within real-world business cases in the Sicilian economic and socio-cultural context. As a result of this analysis, students will better understand the realities of applying ethical frameworks to complex, global business environments, and also recognize the medium- and long-term impacts of corporate decisions that can lead to not only thriving businesses ready to adapt to the demands of new and evolving markets, but also to sustain local communities and address complex economic and social challenges through innovation.\n",

Regardless, you will work with local community partners and professional Italian designers as mentors to help shape a design response to an unmet need or opportunity in historic Ortigia and/or the city of Siracusa.\n\nYour mentors will lead the design team in ways that are much like professional practice. They will help divide the work into manageable parts and smaller working groups, and you will collaboratively determine ambitious, yet achievable goals given the meeting schedule for the summer practicum.\n\nYou will be working alongside other design students (apparel design, architecture, graphic design, interior design, product design, and retail merchandising) to realize at least some aspects of the design proposal at full scale—as prototypes, partial models, or bespoke objects or events. In previous terms, for example, community projects included: designing and building a gateway structure at the edge of the sea, implementing way finding strategies, and screen printing apparel and accessories—all as part of neighborhood revitalization; and generating adaptive reuse strategies for an historic structure in the center of Ortigia, which included graphic identity and branding, prototyping furniture and build-outs, and hosting a communal event to share ideas.\n\nImportantly, your time commitment for this course is determined as a work schedule might be in a firm. You are expected to attend and work/learn at the scheduled meeting times; there is no expectation for practicum work outside of your scheduled hours. (The work/learn meeting schedule will, in total, meet workload expectations for a 3-credit course.)",

The course engages students through an interactive learning approach which takes place in Sicily, as one of the most crucial locations to directly observe, live, and experience migration challenges in the Mediterranean, as well as get the real sense of what managing migration “crises” practically means. Moreover, it offers the chance to develop comparative research designs with other countries, regions, or critical southern borders elsewhere (e.g., US-Mexico border; Myanmar-Thailand border, etc.).\n\nBuilding on this background, this research program aims to introduce undergraduate students to some of the main research methods that are used to explain and do research on migration, asylum, and human rights in the Mediterranean. As there are many ways to do research on these topics, methodologies here included are not intended to be exhaustive. The program delves into the methodology and the research process and offers students the opportunity to learn some of the analytical methods and data collection techniques adopted to investigate migrants and asylum seekers, as well as to implement comparative research designs. Moreover, the course focuses on the ethical challenges which arise for researchers engaged in the study of migration and conducting fieldwork with migrants, including the vulnerability of the research subjects, the issue of transparency, the kind of language adopted, the potential unintended negative consequences for vulnerable actors, and the delicate relationship between the research and the migrant.\n\nOverall, the course aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice, giving students some guidance to understand, learn and experience some of the main appropriate research approaches, methodological and data-collection techniques in relation to the many aspects of migration. Moreover, students will have the possibility to shape their own questions and ensuing analysis, taking advantage of resources in Sicily as well as, possibly, analyzing data and sources in the US and implement a comparative research approach.\n\nNote that the Migration, Human Rights, & the Media course is a co-curricular course to this one. Any students taking this research course will also need to take the Migration, Human Rights, & the Media course to gain the relevant contextual knowledge of this complex topic.",
