    "info": "building a new business is a difficult endeavor anywhere in the world; tenacity, creativity, and endless intrinsic motivation are needed to drive the entrepreneurial spirit. successful entrepreneurship also requires government and institutional support, infrastructure, and investment. this is clear in the development of “hubs” —tech, finance, ai, etc.—in urban centers around the globe. such factors create business ecosystems where new entrants to a specific field can thrive. this is also true in italy.\n\nas one of the world’s most industrialized economies, italy has important manufacturing, finance, and agricultural hubs that foster entrepreneurial growth. however, in southern italy, the obstacles to entrepreneurship are outsized in comparison to northern italy. poor infrastructure, low cooperation, and a lack of entrepreneurial education have helped to perpetuate the slow development of the south. young people often move north or abroad to study and work. this phenomenon, oftentimes dubbed the “brain drain,” can also be seen replicated in other highly industrialized countries, where capital, knowledge, and labor end up concentrating in specific geographical areas creating social divides. nonetheless, entrepreneurship in southern italy is growing. in recent years, over 50% of new small businesses registered in italy were concentrated in the south and island regions of the country. thanks to focused national and regional funding initiatives and collective advocacy movements for business development in southern italy, new companies have been able to take root.",

    "info": "ethics and integrity in supply chain management (scm) are continually coming into question as global discussions of fair trade, labor practices, and corruption are more frequently exposed to be connected to business-as-usual practices. sicily can be viewed as a microcosm of global supply chain challenges and as a laboratory for ethical business practices. from international labor market competition and inequality to the logistics of operating from an island and the implications of corruption and organized crime, businesses of all scales find themselves benefitting from the island’s geopolitical integration in the european union but also struggling with poor infrastructure, transnational competition, complex transportation logistics, and shifting cultural beliefs. \n\nthis course focuses on the language and tools of sustainability and responsibility as new standard currencies in business and challenges students to consider complex issues of ethics and integrity within real-world business cases in the sicilian economic and socio-cultural context. as a result of this analysis, students will better understand the realities of applying ethical frameworks to complex, global business environments, and also recognize the medium- and long-term impacts of corporate decisions that can lead to not only thriving businesses ready to adapt to the demands of new and evolving markets, but also to sustain local communities and address complex economic and social challenges through innovation.",

(the work/learn meeting schedule will, in total, meet workload expectations for a 3-credit course.)",
