This is not a course where you will find the answers to these questions – there may not be concrete answers to some of these questions. Instead, it will be an active learning environment where we talk with and listen to organizational leaders to learn more about the complex issues they face, how our own ethical views play into these questions, and think through how we can adapt and adjust our strategies to fit with what we learn and how our organizations want to grow.",
