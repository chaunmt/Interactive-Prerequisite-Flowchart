are few things more basic and bonding between humans than making and sharing food together. to offer food and drink is a gesture of hospitality throughout the world. when we cook and eat, we can traverse our family’s generations and migrations through and across regional and national boundaries. by understanding the practices surrounding someone’s food, we can come to understand a great deal about their culture. indeed, food is often a site of cultural fusion and hybridity, indicating the human ability to share, adapt, and change. food, cooking, eating, and the rituals surrounding them reflect and are informed by ethnicity, race, gender, sexuality, nationality, migration, and class. for these reasons, food is an excellent topic through which to explore intersectionality, empowerment, and cultural memory—three major topics in chicana/o and latinx studies. \n\nthis course is a study of food as an integral part of human experience, but particularly the experiences with food across latinidades, social groups of latin america living in the united states. we study food as a form of cultural expression but also as a mechanism of power and inequality. as such, we examine topics such as the food service industry, farm worker organizing, food insecurity, cultural appropriation, and agri-business and food production). each of these topics focus our attention on inequality and injustices, such as racism, sexism, hunger, and other difficult subjects. however, these topics also reveal resistance and agency among latinos and latinas, as well as latinx people, the gender neutral term intended to include the wide range of gender identities among people of latin american heritage living in the u.s. by understanding the labor and politics of the food industry, uneven access to food, and society’s expectations about latinx cuisines, we come to understand the structural forces that generate notions of race, gender, sexuality, nationality, human migration, and material inequity. through our sharing of food, recipes, and the stories behind them, particularly the foods prepared for días de los muertos (trans: days of the dead) we will gain understanding of our diverse experiences, looking at our past as well as our present, and the memories and structural conditions that shape our experiences. to deepen our knowledge, we learn from and engage with latinx urban farmers and come to appreciate the indigenous mexican cultural values for the environment and sustainability.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"CHIC

society. this course will study race and ethnicity in order to rethink foundational ideas, histories, and movements in united states society and beyond.  an overriding theme of the course will be an examination of how power relations are constructed through racism and its tie to colonialism; and conversely, how racialized communities--particularly african american, latin@/e, asian american, and american indian--are sites of survival and resistance. therefore, a guiding question that we will explore and discuss collectively will be what role has/does race play in re-creating unequal and hierarchical social arrangements in u.s. society?\n\nunderstanding that the practice of race is not a series of isolated events, but an institutional phenomenon that works on a societal level, we will ask further, what purposes has/is race used for? to what ends has race been applied to ascertain who has access to resources, who works where, and who is a legitimate member of u.s. society?\n\nindeed, a number of scholars agree that race has been and continues to be used to maintain or reconstruct an unequal society, for the benefit of particular interests, in the form of systematic oppression, but ethnic studies scholars have also ascertained that black, indigenous, and brown communities have also responded to racial oppression in a myriad of ways and a diversity of peoples have challenged institutional and everyday racism.  in light of this we will also ask, how have colonized people and their allies challenged, resisted, and accommodated racial oppression in u.s. society?\n\nin particular, the class will close out considering the movement for ethnic studies in the k-12 school system across the u.s. and the ways in which it does not only seek to add new voices and perspectives, but to rethink the approach to education generally as a transformative process. \n\nall in all, this course will analyze race and ethnicity to question and collectively address the limits and possibilities of a democratic society and seek to propose alternative practices that might make our society more democratic and egalitarian. indeed, another emphasis of this course in regards to the larger inquire of democratic practice will be how racial and ethnic identities and social forces intersect with other categories such as class, gender, sexuality, and nationality. in these ways it is in the hope that students use these themes as a window into thinking critically about our society so that we might determine our own position in order to contribute to on-going struggles for a better world.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"CHIC 3114","subject":"CHIC","id":"3114","title":"US-Mex.Perspectives","info":"the relations of mexico and the united
