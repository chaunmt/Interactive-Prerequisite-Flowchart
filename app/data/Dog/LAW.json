asked to complete a form specifying their preferences and to submit a resume, transcript, and cover letter to be used in the placement process. students will be assigned based on their requests and the judges’ needs. after placement, each student arranges a work schedule with the assigned judge and his or her staff.  students are encouraged to arrange their class schedules to have several large blocks of time available for fieldwork; free mornings are especially important for attending court hearings.\n\nfieldwork in chambers generally includes both substantive assignments in research and writing and observation of court proceedings. substantive assignments will depend upon the nature of the court’s calendar and may include such work as preparing a memorandum or proposed order and decision on a summary judgment motion, summarizing and evaluating deposition testimony, or researching substantive legal issues raised in a motion, trial, or appeal. students may observe a variety of proceedings, ranging from settlement conferences to motions hearings to trials to appellate arguments. they may be proceedings conducted in cases for which the student is performing research or they may be part of unrelated cases. the precise nature of the assignments and observation opportunities in chambers is at the discretion of the judge and the judge’s staff.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"LAW 6058","subject":"LAW","id":"6058","title":"Human Rights Advocacy","info":"this course will study the histories, philosophies and activities of human

things clients want to know is what are their available remedies.  they will ask you about your strategy either to get them the relief they seek or to defend against a remedy they do not want to provide. before they decide to pay for the effort of proving their entitlement to relief, they want to know if the available remedy will be worth the effort.  this course tells you what types and kinds of relief courts can provide. in it, we will explore not just basic and advanced methods of proving monetary damages, but also how to obtain injunctions, restitution, and declaratory relief. the questions we will ask throughout are what can the plaintiff (or the defendant) get? why that and not something else? which of the available remedies or defenses is best for the situation at hand? what are the strategic and practical ways to achieve the desired result? remedies integrates threads from different parts of the law school curriculum and will explore options that will make you a more valuable and effective attorney.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"LAW 6201","subject":"LAW","id":"6201","title":"Land Use Planning","info":"public control of land use and development and its

intersection between power and conflict, and the ways in which cultural and other specific identities may inform our experiences.  students in this course will improve their conflict competency - defined as the ability to identify and effectively respond to conflict - and will develop practical skills that correlate with better outcomes in personal and professional life. \n\nclass sessions

systems, the factors that influence its quality, and the insights from social scientists that can critique and improve it. the class will introduce the students to several guest speakers (defense lawyers, prosecutors, judges, social scientists and mitigation specialists) who will put the role and quality of sentencing advocacy in perspective. most significantly, students will learn themselves, through hands-on involvement in actual pending cases, how to strategize, research, and develop an effective sentencing petition. thus, the class instructor will seek out cutting-edge/novel/interesting

effectively represent low- income taxpayers who have a tax controversy. tax cases generally include audits of tax returns, filing and trying cases in tax court and federal district court, and bringing taxpayers into collection compliance. since the earned income credit and refundable child tax credits are now the major form of public welfare benefits for low-income workers and, thus, often an important component of tax controversies, the clinic offers opportunities to work on these issues with clients. clinic students do not generally prepare tax returns unless it is required to resolve the controversy.\n\nclinic students participate in a clinic seminar during the fall semester, which provides training in clinic office procedures, lawyering skills and professional responsibility with an emphasis on those relevant to tax practice, and tax procedure and law relevant to representing low-income taxpayers. guest speakers from the irs, mn department of revenue and practicing bar provide useful information about the practice of tax law.\n\nstudents who would benefit from enrollment include those that have an interest in tax, business or bankruptcy practice who will find it helpful to understand the workings of the tax administration authority (i.e. irs/mndor); who are interested in pursuing a career in public interest law; who have an interest in administrative and statutory law
