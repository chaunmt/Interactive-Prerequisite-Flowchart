Students will then develop the ability to present their findings in a clear and concise manner that is understandable to and can be acted upon by a cross-functional audience of high-level decision makers.",

But, what kind of information are they collecting? Are merchants allowed to gather your shopping history and use it to send you targeted advertising, or to sell it to other companies for profit? Should other people be able to post your personal information or photos online without your consent? Can the government read your emails, track your online browsing, or intercept your text messages? This course considers how growing concerns about privacy and national security affect the First Amendment and the rights of journalists to gather and report the news. We will read significant court decisions and take a look at current statutory and regulatory initiatives both in the United States and abroad. You can expect lively debates and discussion, and the opportunity to explore a privacy or national security issue in depth in a substantial research paper.",

We will focus especially on ways and instances in which the law - on the books or in application - treated men and women differently and the reasons or rationalizations for doing so; ways in which it distinguished among women based on status (free or slave, single or married, citizen or non, adult or child, able or disabled), race, class, and sexuality; how women's legal status changed over time and the limits of that change; and, finally, on women's individual and collective efforts to claim a right to themselves, equality in the workplace, and in civil and political rights. \n\nLaw courses are generally case (or at least casebook) centered. This seminar offers a break from that format. Our lens will be historical. Most of our readings will be by historians whose principal fields of study include women's history, legal history, the history of citizenship, labor history, and the history of sexuality.

State trial court placements are with judges handling criminal, civil, family, or juvenile court matters and with problem-solving courts (e.g., drug court). Externships may also be available at the Office of Administrative Hearings and with the federal Immigration Court. Separate application to those courts is required; watch for notice about placement possibilities through the Career Office. \n\nFederal court placements (Federal District Court, Federal Magistrate-Judges, and Federal Court of Appeals) are made using an application process that occurs a few months before the start of the term.  Notification will be sent to all students about deadlines for applying. For the rest of the placements, students registered for the class will be asked to complete a form specifying their preferences and to submit a resume, transcript, and cover letter to be used in the placement process. Students will be assigned based on their requests and the judges’ needs. After placement, each student arranges a work schedule with the assigned judge and his or her staff.  Students are encouraged to arrange their class schedules to have several large blocks of time available for fieldwork; free mornings are especially important for attending court hearings.\n\nFieldwork in chambers generally includes both substantive assignments in research and writing and observation of court proceedings. Substantive assignments will depend upon the nature of the court’s calendar and may include such work as preparing a memorandum or proposed order and decision on a summary judgment motion, summarizing and evaluating deposition testimony, or researching substantive legal issues raised in a motion, trial, or appeal. Students may observe a variety of proceedings, ranging from settlement conferences to motions hearings to trials to appellate arguments. They may be proceedings conducted in cases for which the student is performing research or they may be part of unrelated cases.

    "info": "Terrorism claims an increasing number of fatalities each year, indiscriminately affecting a broad range of countries and societies, whether developed or developing, warn-torn or at peace and has, in past years, dominated security discourse at domestic, regional and international levels.\n\nThe 9/11 attacks represented a watershed moment in counter-terrorism regulation, resulting in the United Nations Security Council declaring the phenomenon of international terrorism a ‘threat to international peace and security’ and the adoption of extensive measures aimed at addressing relevant regulatory gaps at the level of the United Nations, regional organizations and individual states. This regulatory trend has not significantly dwindled since and has in fact seen a boost with the rise of Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and the so-called foreign fighters phenomenon, with every new incident prompting states and international organizations to contemplate additional legal and policy responses. Consequently, measures aimed at preventing and countering terrorism have now seeped into almost every aspect of domestic, regional or international policies and regulation, including education, banking and finances, immigration and asylum, Internet and communication technologies, the functioning of civil society, charitable and humanitarian organizations, etc.\n\nAgainst this background, the seminar aims to give students an overview of the international legal framework on terrorism and counter-terrorism. It will address the United Nations counter-terrorism architecture and the counter-terrorism response at the level of the United Nations as well as selected regional and domestic initiatives. Discussion will cover a wide range of topics, spanning from the definition of terrorism and the conditions conducive to its spread, to a broad spectrum of counter-terrorism measures, including criminalization of terrorist acts, investigating and prosecuting such acts and relevant fair trial issues, use of force against (suspected) terrorists, preventing terrorist use of the Internet and communication technologies, the foreign fighters phenomenon, etc. Counter-terrorism measures will consistently be analyzed against their compliance with international human rights law. The seminar will further examine the interplay between counter-terrorism regulation and the law governing armed conflict as well as international criminal law.\n\nStudents will study and discuss primary sources, such as international and regional treaties and conventions, United Nations Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, as well as policy documents and academic literature. Students will finish the seminar equipped with a working knowledge of the global legal regime against terrorism, including the main challenges faced in this area and current trends in regulation.",

Attorneys General in 43 states are elected statewide on a partisan basis. The combination of sweeping jurisdiction and constitutional independence has given rise to a unique American legal institution of growing importance. State attorneys general are currently leading the national response to the opioid crisis, nicotine-related health issues, immigration, health care and a multitude of other critical issues. Students will learn about the broad and diverse work of state AGs. The course will cover the day-to-day challenges that state Attorneys General face, which includes delivering the legal advice that will guide state government in a constitutional and ethical manner. The course will also cover the relationship of Attorneys General with Governors, state legislatures and agencies, the federal government, the private bar, and a myriad of advocacy organizations. It will focus both day to day responsibilities as well as on some of the most controversial legal issues affecting society today. Although Attorneys General are often in the news litigating both in favor and in opposition to Presidential policies, the focus of this class is not on suing or defending the President.\nAlthough each State is unique, the course will demonstrate that State Attorneys General address similar challenges and issues across the various state. The course will show how decisions that Attorneys General make often reflect the independence of the Office. This independence is most often revealed when Governors, legislatures, other elected officials, state agencies or the federal government exceed their constitutional or statutory authority. The course considers also the unique ethics issues that Attorneys General and their staff must confront.",

To a lesser extent, we will also look at China’s actions to restrict U.S. access to the Chinese market, protect (or take, in some cases) U.S. intellectual property, and to block U.S. investment in China.\n\nThe U.S. economic relationship with China has drastically changed over the last five years. To date, the Biden Administration has continued many of the policies implemented by the Trump Administration with respect to China. In the near term, economic friction between China and the United States is certain. Over the long term, although the precise points of conflict will change, it seems likely that economic conflict between the two countries will continue. \n\nThis seminar will use the conflict to examine key legal elements of U.S. trade and investment policy. In particular, this seminar will examine:  What is the “trade war” and what U.S. and Chinese policies does it include?; What are the origins and impacts of the trade war?; What legal, political, and economic factors contribute to the trade war?; and What “off-ramps” exist to de-escalate the conflict?\n\nAlthough we will focus on legal developments relating to the trade war, we will also discuss diplomatic, economic, and political considerations driving economic conflict between the countries.

Students meet once a week and explore sentencing processes in state and federal sentencing systems, the role of sentencing advocacy in securing favorable outcomes, the factors that influence its quality, and the insights from social scientists that can critique and improve it. The class draws on the wealth of interdisciplinary expertise on the University of Minnesota campus as well as in our local professional community.\n\nMost notably, however, the students learn by doing—through hands-on involvement in actual clemency or 'second look' petitions. Each student gets their own case, under the Professor's supervision, and as such, will get to know a real human being and their family members, all of whom have served a substantial portion of a long sentence and have many more years to go.

We are in the business, then, of conflict resolution - yet we rarely take the time to lay a proper foundation for that work. \n\nConflict work begins with the self:  understanding one's own innate responses and preferences when dealing with conflict.  Accordingly, this class begins with self-assessment and self-reflective exercises designed to improve awareness of our triggers, blind spots, and biases.  The role of effective communication in conflict resolution will be central.  The class will also examine the intersection between power and conflict, and the ways in which cultural and other specific identities may inform our experiences.  Students in this course will improve their conflict competency - defined as the ability to identify and effectively respond to conflict - and will develop practical skills that correlate with better outcomes in personal and professional life. \n\nClass sessions will be a mixture of lecture, small group discussion, simulation and role plays, and self-reflective exercises.",

The course will analyze how factors like race and class have shaped the LGBTQ rights movement in the US and beyond, with an emphasis on how laws and policies that appear neutral on their face can nevertheless have a disparate impact on members of the LGBTQ community.\n\nStudents will study primary and scholarly sources, supplemented by narrative and other artistic material.

In what the Supreme Court has acknowledged has become an essentially administrative system of criminal  justice, sentencing advocacy is now a critical - in some cases, the only - component in the criminal defense lawyer's arsenal, and the site of some of the most sophisticated developments in the litigation of criminal cases. Taking this understanding as its backdrop, this class explores the role of sentencing advocacy in state and federal sentencing systems, the factors that influence its quality, and the insights from social scientists that can critique and improve it. The class will introduce the students to several guest speakers (defense lawyers, prosecutors, judges, social scientists and mitigation specialists) who will put the role and quality of sentencing advocacy in perspective. Most significantly, students will learn themselves, through hands-on involvement in actual pending cases, how to strategize, research, and develop an effective sentencing petition. Thus, the class instructor will seek out cutting-edge/novel/interesting sentencing issues in the cases of court-appointed lawyers in state and federal cases (with the appointed lawyer's consent) for which students can draft the sentencing memoranda, research the sentencing guideline and mitigation issues, and develop the client's counter-narrative to the prosecutor's position.

Most corporations of any size have operations and assets in more than one country. In addition, many troubled corporations are part of a corporate group that includes affiliated entities operating in numerous countries, many of which will file their own insolvency proceedings in their countries of incorporation. The most obvious example of this trend is the Lehman Brothers group of companies: approximately 80 Lehman affiliates commenced insolvency proceedings in 16 countries. International Bankruptcy is a course designed to deal with this world of multi-jurisdictional insolvency.\n\nThe course consists of two modules, Comparative Insolvency Law and Managing Cross-Border Cases. The first module covers six class sessions. After an introductory session explaining the role of insolvency law in national economies and setting out the framework for comparative insolvency law, we will survey the insolvency laws of Canada, Brazil and Mexico, Japan and China, England and Western Europe. Common topics include prerequisites that must be satisfied before an insolvency case can be filed, whether an automatic stay of collection and other proceedings exists, how the case is administered (judicial, administrative or other), and whether the system is focused on liquidation or permits reorganization. We will then turn to Managing Cross-Border Cases. We will devote two sessions to the European Unions insolvency regulation that co-ordinates insolvency proceedings pending in EU nations. Four sessions will analyze chapter 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Chapter 15 facilitates cooperation among courts in countries in which related insolvency proceedings are pending. Our final session will focus on the use of chapter 11 by foreign entities.",

    "info": "This course introduces students to the original meaning and significance of religious law and ethics within Judaism. Law is the single most important part of Jewish history and identity. At the same time, law is also the least understood part of Judaism and has often been the source of criticism and hatred. We shall therefore confront one of the most important parts of Jewish civilization and seek to understand it on its own terms. In demonstrating how law becomes a fundamental religious and ethical ideal, the course will focus on the biblical and Rabbinic periods but spans the entire history of Judaism. Consistent with the First Amendment, the approach taken is secular. There are no prerequisites: the course is open to all qualified students.\n\nThe course begins with ideas of law in ancient Babylon and then studies the ongoing history of those ideas. The biblical idea that a covenant binds Israel to God, along with its implications for human worth - including the view of woman as person - will be examined. Comparative cultural issues include the reinterpretations of covenant within Christianity and Islam. The course investigates the rabbinic concept of oral law, the use of law to maintain the civil and religious stability of the Jewish people, and the kabbalistic transformation of law. The course concludes with contemporary Jewish thinkers who return to the Bible while seeking to establish a modern system of universal ethics.\n\nThe course investigates the historical origins of the premise of the American founding: the idea that \\\"all men [humans] are created equal.\\\" How does it become \\\"self-evident\\\" that every human is or should be a legal person, with rights that should properly be inviolable? The course employs the method of academic religious studies to teach the immense cultural contributions of antiquity to illuminate and help address contemporary cultural problems. The course also investigates the origins of constitutional thought in antiquity and provides comparative evidence to shed new light on current debates about the relation of the Supreme Court (as interpreters) to the normative text of the American Constitution. \n\nThe premise of the course is the discipline of academic religious studies. The assumptions of the course are therefore academic and secular, as required by the First Amendment. All texts and all religious traditions will be examined analytically and critically. Students are expected to understand and master this approach, which includes questioning conventional cultural assumptions about the composition and authorship of the Bible. Willingness to ask such questions and openness to new ways of thinking are essential to success in the course.",

This course brings practitioner and academic perspectives together to focus on the major civil, administrative and criminal laws that have been used to contain health care fraud and abuse, broadly defined as actions by health care providers (e.g., physicians and physician practices, medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturers, clinical laboratories) that are inconsistent with accepted business and medical practices. These laws include the federal civil False Claims Act, the Stark Act, the federal Anti-kickback Statute and the remedies and civil and criminal penalties available to governmental entities and civil litigants.

Many have argued that traditional legal forms of association, especially the business corporation and the non-profit corporation, do not provide good fits for the purpose of this emerging form. A variety of new legal forms are being developed, including the low-profit limited liability company (L3C), the benefit corporation, and the social purpose corporation. This course explores the challenges facing social enterprises, and how both traditional and new forms of legal associations respond to those challenges.",

    "info": "As scientific knowledge about the effects of trauma on the brain has increased, the legal context surrounding brain injury in professional and youth sports has changed dramatically over the past decade. Legal action includes multiple federal class action lawsuits, new sports concussion statutes in all fifty states, new regulations in college and high school, new insurance markets, and a myriad of tort law suits in state and federal court. Many policy recommendations have been proposed, and many reforms have been enacted by sports leagues. The evolving legal landscape for sports concussions thus provides an exciting opportunity to see how law responds in response to scientific advances. This seminarthe first in the country to focus specifically on legal liability and sports concussionswill examine the emerging science, law, and policy of sports concussions. The seminar will feature a number of guest speakers, and will place an emphasis on developing students legal research and writing skills. Students will be required to complete a 20 page research paper, and no prior knowledge of brain science or sports is required or presumed.",

    "info": "In this digital driven world, more legal professionals are migrating to a combination of law and coding as dual set of skills are becoming increasingly valuable and programming expertise is certainly providing a competitive advantage when it comes to advising legal tech companies. \n\nLawyers need an understanding of the possibilities and limitations of coding, how to implement it, and how long it would take to develop certain solutions. This seminar will provide that foundation. It aims to equip prospective legal professionals with the tools to understand the basic concepts of coding relating to technologies and applications that are changing the legal profession. This will enable them to become familiar with the design and operation of legal technologies.\n\nGiven that information is increasingly being stored electronically, coding is of value because it assists with searching, organising, filtering and presenting information. This is of particular use for the purposes of discovery in litigation. In addition, data analytics and artificial intelligence use algorithms which facilitate research and review activities, conducting these tasks in ways that are cheaper and faster than human lawyers. Since these techniques are code-based, lawyers will draw value in the medium to long term from understanding these skills and systems.\n \nThis seminar provides: an introduction to legal tech in the digital age; an overview of lawyers as project managers; an overview of artificial intelligence and its impact on legal tech; an introduction to programming in Python, machine learning and natural language processing techniques as part of legal tech solutions; and insights into the latest trends in legal tech. Students will not be expected to be fluent coders by the end of the course, but to have an appreciation and understanding of the capabilities of coding.",

The student attorneys can assist these student-athletes by conducting contractual cross-referencing to ensure compliance with this requirement. Additionally, the student attorneys can assist with due diligence regarding brands offering their partnership, assist with document drafting for compliance purposes, and review the contracts these brands are proposing to the clinic clients.\n\nRecommended prereq/coreq - LAW 6837 Contract Drafting",

In the Civil Rights Appellate Clinic, students will engage in collaborative litigation in the state and federal courts of appeals on behalf of clients facing issues relating to civil rights, social and criminal justice, racial equity, and/or individual rights and liberties. Students will develop appellate advocacy skills while working to ensure that every individual has the opportunity to live as their fullest self with dignity and respect. Our cases harness the impact of the appellate courts in an effort to protect and expand individual rights and to make our systems of government more fair and just.\n\nCase projects typically include representing parties or amici curiae before the state or federal courts of appeals or courts of last resort. Students will strengthen their legal analytical skills by engaging in critical analysis of issues raised in the clinic’s cases. They will learn strategies to become mini-experts in the subject matter of each project, as well as learn general skills in appellate practice. They will strengthen their written advocacy abilities through brief and memorandum writing under close supervision of and in collaboration with the clinic director. They will strengthen their oral advocacy skills through oral arguments (when possible), simulations, or class presentations. The clinic also will foster skills in collaboration, as students will work in teams on case assignments and engage with all clinic participants in case rounds. Finally, students will hone their ability to conduct themselves in a professional manner while working with clinic clients and co-counsel.\n\nIn the weekly seminar, students will study key aspects of appellate advocacy, strategize on casework, and engage with guest speakers who are experts in the appellate field.\n",

Depending on the resolution of their case at the trial level, students will write appellate briefs to the Board of Immigration Appeals and the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals. For their representation of human trafficking victims, students interview their clients, research the relevant law, interact with government officials who have investigated the trafficking scheme, and prepare applications for visas that permit their clients to remain in the United States. Students also represent immigrant detainees at hearings in Immigration Court to determine if they have defenses to deportation. Students also work on public policy and community outreach projects which bring them into contact with immigrant rights groups at the state and national level. As a result of their work in the clinic, students learn about U.S. immigration law and policy and participate in the Binger Center's innovative strategies for improving the lives of immigrants through strategic litigation, well informed public policy, and community outreach and education.\n\nLAW 6872 Immigration Law strongly recommended.",

Students meet once a week and explore sentencing processes in state and federal sentencing systems, the role of sentencing advocacy in securing favorable outcomes, the factors that influence its quality, and the insights from social scientists that can critique and improve it.
