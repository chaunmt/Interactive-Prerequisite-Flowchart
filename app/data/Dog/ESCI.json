Assignments develop research skills, writing proficiency, oral expression, logical reasoning, and critical analysis. Emphasis is placed on current debates, particularly regarding global climate change, such that students develop critical and ethical thinking skills related to these challenges. Reading assignments are chosen to show that solutions to environmental issues are part of a larger societal evolution, where individuals in society are viewed as historical agents, one that involves a combination of technological advances, science policy, and shared individual and community responsibility. Work for this course involves synthesis of datasets, writing of essays based on journal and magazine articles, and group presentations. The science and policy part of the course is balanced by writers and artist?s expression of the beauty and awesomeness of polar landscapes. Three credits are justified by the amount of work required to come prepared for seminar, upon which the success of the course rests, and the time spent on personal research and writing assignments, as well as the preparation of group presentations.",

In doing so, we will explore ways for everyone to better take responsibility for their role in optimizing public health, maximizing economic benefits, maintaining biodiversity, and protecting the integrity of surface water features on our landscape. \n\nEmphasis will be placed on how our choices and solutions will in the long term affect our principal drinking water source--the groundwater that is hosted in ancient rocks in the north and in the deep subsurface, younger limestone and sandstone in the south, and the sediments of the most recent Ice Age from which our soils have formed. A full-day field trip planned for a Saturday in September will examine how societal choices affect our use of and protection of water resources in our rivers and lakes, and a second full-day trip on a Saturday in October will address the same issues in relation to our largest source of drinking water--our wells.

Scientific literature and popular press are replete with the view that global sea level is rising in the 21st century. However, in reality, some sectors of the marine shorelines are experiencing a sea-level fall. Thus understanding what controls changing sea level is key to guide society?s response and to promote responsible public policy. Students will develop scientific fluency in fundamental coastal processes associated with waves, tides, beaches, storms (hurricanes), rising or sinking land, river deltas, and nearshore regions in general. These coastal processes will be examined in the face of changing sea level and its interrelationship with land-use policies, engineering practices, human infrastructure, coastal laws, risk assessment in the insurance industry, and global geopolitics. Assignments will enhance students? skills in research, logical reasoning, and critical analysis as well as foster lifelong skills in writing proficiency and oral communication. The societal challenges posed by changing sea level, both local and international, lie at the heart of this seminar.",

Building from a foundation of what we know about life today and what we have learned about past life preserved in the rock record on Earth, we are looking for signs of life on habitable worlds within our solar system (including Mars, Europa, Ganymede, and Enceladus). Further, with an ever-increasing catalog of worlds detected around stars outside of our solar system, we are studying how to look for life on worlds beyond our solar system.\n\nThis course will address questions that are fundamental to astrobiology, including: What is life? What are the physical and chemical requisites for life as we know it? Were these requisites present on other worlds in the past, or are they present today? How do we look for signs of past or present life on other worlds? To help address these questions, students will learn the basic principles of astronomy (star formation, planetary accretion), geology (planetary composition, geologic time, plate tectonics, preservation of biosignatures), chemistry (elements and reactions essential to life, chemical signatures life produces), and biology (metabolism, chemotrophy, phototrophy, biological innovation).\n\nStudents will complete this course with a deeper understanding of: (1) how our solar system and planet formed; (2) how life developed and evolved; (3) planetary geology and geologic time; (4) the strategies for life in extreme environments; (5) the conditions necessary for a habitable world; (6) past, present, and future missions looking for life on other worlds; and (7) the place of our planet in the universe.",

Environmental issues surrounding urban and agricultural groundwater water quality and use are a primary focus. We will be using the underlying scientific principles of geology, hydrology, biology, and chemistry of karst and cave systems in order to more clearly grapple with these environmental issues. We will examine the current limitations of our technologies to model groundwater flow in complex cave and karst environments, and discuss the ramifications of these limitations on the development of reasonable zoning regulations, agricultural practices, and groundwater quality criteria. Additionally, this course aims to show that caves have often acted as inhabited places throughout history (even in modern times) and may contain cultural (archaeological) resources worthy of protection. Finally, this course hopes to encourage an appreciation for the roles that caves and karst play in modern society as gas and groundwater reservoirs, the latter of which can be compromised by the migration of contaminated waters. Students will read peer-reviewed research to identify for themselves the environmental issues facing caves and karst and to begin to propose their own potential solutions. Student appreciation for the fragility of cave environments will be grounded in first-hand experiences gained during field trips to local caves.",

Manoomin/wild rice is an aquatic grass that grows naturally in shallow lakes and streams, but unfortunately, due to its high sensitivity to various environmental stressors (e.g., perturbed water levels, contaminants, competitive and invasive species, and climate change), it has been experiencing progressive declines across the region.  This has been alarming for Native and non-Native people for whom manoomin/wild rice holds special meaning.  \n\nIn this course, students will gain an interdisciplinary perspective on how multiple components of the environment, as well as people’s relationships and actions with it, together influence the health of manoomin/wild rice stands.  Understanding what supports manoomin/wild rice requires a look at local lake to greater watershed-scale conditions; interacting ecological, hydrological, geochemical, and geological processes; and different environmental management approaches driven by diverse values.  While manoomin/wild rice has served as a flashpoint between tribes and industries that impair their environment, we will learn how it can also become a rallying point for Indigenous knowledge-holders and conventional academic scientists to share different worldviews, for tribal and non-tribal policy-makers to collaboratively manage resources, and for all communities living around manooomin/wild rice waters to be better stewards of the whole environment.\n\nStudents will learn a holistic approach to studying manoomin/wild rice and its environment through readings and exercises that span disciplines.  They will also participate in community-engaged learning activities that integrate perspectives beyond conventional academic cultures that can deepen our understanding of the environment.  There will also be a two-night field trip during the first weekend of the semester for students to experience first-hand manoomin/wild rice waters, traditional processing methods, and Ojibwe craft-making with elders from the White Earth Indian Reservation.\n",

Students with stronger backgrounds in earth or other physical sciences may also find much of interest, although the approach will be largely non-quantitative. The course will introduce undergraduate students to the dazzling variety of worlds in our solar system and illustrate how many of the planetary scale systems of the Earth compare and contrast to those of other planets. The course will also consider the dynamical and chemical processes that lead to the origin of our solar system and Earth. Additionally, we will also survey recent exciting observations and discoveries of exoplanets, including consideration of how the diversity of other solar systems aids understanding of our own. The physical and chemical principles underlying planetary processes will be a unifying theme of the course. The course will take advantage of the many resources made available by planetary exploration missions, including those producing the most recent new observations. Owing to the fast-moving pace of discovery in planetary science the curricular content will be and updated each time the course is taught.\n  \nprereq: An interest in the solar system and planets.",

Following an introduction to the development of environmentaljustice as a concept in the US since the reconstruction following the Civil War, we will consider specific case studies during the 20th and 21st centuries that align with topics in the Earth and Environmental Sciences, including petroleum extraction and hydrofracturing, mapping and resource extraction, native American environmental justice, hazardous waste disposal, and climate justice, as framed by Robert Bullard?s 6 Pillars of the Environmental Justice Movement. We will conclude by exploring similarities and differences in how Environmental Justice is addressed in the US compared to other countries globally. The overall course goal is for students to gain an understanding of the pervasiveness of environmental justice issues and of social and scientific approaches to evaluating issues in the broad field of environmental justice.",

Additionally, students will develop problem-solving skills in learning how to design algorithms to achieve a task and in learning how to troubleshoot and debug their code. Students taking the class at the 5xxx level will be required to complete a programming project related to their own research. This course will be different from other introductory-level programming courses in that it will have a spatial emphasis and focus on examples and datasets related to the Earth and environmental sciences. Students will learn how to access a variety of Earth and environmental science data repositories and work with data in standard formats (i.e. NetCDF). Working with geographically referenced data in different projections will be explored using different toolboxes available for that purpose. Plotting of data will also be extensively covered including the production of publication-quality figures and animations. Prereq: upper division or instructor consent.",

This radiation includes multiple invasions of the aquatic realm by groups as diverse as turtles, ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, and mosasaurs, and also encompasses two of the three groups of vertebrates to evolve active flight, namely birds and pterosaurs. Dinosaurs, most famous among the reptilian clades, dominated terrestrial ecosystems for over 100 million years and evolved large body sizes unsurpassed by any other terrestrial group. This course will cover the fossil record, evolution and paleobiology of reptiles (including birds) from the Carboniferous to the Present. Using both literature and demonstrations on skeletons/casts, students will learn the basics of reptilian anatomy and biology, and how those are used to infer evolutionary relationships and ecology of the diverse extinct reptilian clades listed above. Methods for inferring phylogenetic relationships, measuring biodiversity in the fossil record, and reconstructing the physiology and life history strategies of extinct reptiles will also be covered. The relationship between major geological events, such as changing climate and continental drift, and the origination, diversification, and extinction of reptilian groups through more than 300 million years of in Earth history will be explored. \nPrerequisites: ESci 1001 or ESci 1002 or Biol 1001 or Biol 1002 or Biol 1009 or instructor consent.",

Geodynamic problems to be discussed include plate cooling, lithospheric deformation, mantle convection, shear (viscous and frictional) heating, subduction, faulting, and their effects on the Earth’s thermochemical structures, geoid and topography, and the distributions of earthquakes and volcanism. Analytical solutions and numerical models of simple geodynamic problems are introduced, and recent applications of complex geodynamic models to explain geological, geophysical, and geochemical observations are discussed based on selected scientific journal articles. Graduate students are expected to present and lead paper discussions, and their performance will be graded and counted towards their participation. \n\nInstructor’s consent will be required if the following prerequisites are not met: ESCI 2201, MATH 1371 and 1372 (or equivalent), and PHYS 1301 and 1302 (or equivalent).",

    "title": "Aqueous Geochemical Analysis",
    "info": "Chemical analysis of natural samples is essential not only in geochemical research but nearly all other subfields of Earth and Environmental Science research today. Some analytical capability routine to geochemists, such as high precision isotope analysis, has also found potential applications in many other disciplines. Outside academia, chemical analysis is fundamental to many activities directly relevant to our everyday life, ranging from pollution monitoring to soil testing. With the explosion of analytical capability and increasing applications of geochemical analysis, there is greater need for students in Earth and Environmental Sciences to get familiarized with some common analytical instruments and to grasp some fundamental principles of analytical chemistry. This course will introduce several modern analytical equipment with a particular focus on plasma source mass spectrometers, as well as important techniques developed for precise and accurate analysis of geological and environmental samples. During this course, students will have access to some of the most advanced analytical equipment in geochemical research and gain hands-on experience during in-class lab practice. The lab practice is primarily designed to illustrate some key concepts covered in lectures, rather than a comprehensive training on instrument operation. At the end of this course, students are expected to be capable of critically evaluating geochemical data and master a set of analytical skills that can serve their future careers in research or other chemical analysis related professions. This course is designed to be accessible to students with limited prior analytical experiences. Prerequisites recommended to attend this course are PHYS 1301 (or equivalency) and CHEM 1061 (or equivalency).",

Geodynamic problems to be discussed include plate cooling, lithospheric deformation, mantle convection, shear (viscous and frictional) heating, subduction, faulting, and their effects on the Earth’s thermochemical structures, geoid and topography, and the distributions of earthquakes and volcanism. Analytical solutions and numerical models of simple geodynamic problems are introduced, and recent applications of complex geodynamic models to explain geological, geophysical, and geochemical observations are discussed based on selected scientific journal articles.",

Some analytical capability routine to geochemists, such as high precision isotope analysis, has also found potential applications in many other disciplines. Outside academia, chemical analysis is fundamental to many activities directly relevant to our everyday life, ranging from pollution monitoring to soil testing. With the explosion of analytical capability and increasing applications of geochemical analysis, there is greater need for students in Earth and Environmental Sciences to get familiarized with some common analytical instruments and to grasp some fundamental principles of analytical chemistry. This course will introduce several modern analytical equipment with a particular focus on plasma source mass spectrometers, as well as important techniques developed for precise and accurate analysis of geological and environmental samples. During this course, students will have access to some of the most advanced analytical equipment in geochemical research and gain hands-on experience during in-class lab practice. The lab practice is primarily designed to illustrate some key concepts covered in lectures, rather than a comprehensive training on instrument operation. At the end of this course, students are expected to be capable of critically evaluating geochemical data and master a set of analytical skills that can serve their future careers in research or other chemical analysis related professions. This course is designed to be accessible to students with limited prior analytical experiences. Prerequisites recommended to attend this course are PHYS 1301 (or equivalency) and CHEM 1061 (or equivalency).\n\n",
