some sectors of the marine shorelines are experiencing a sea-level fall. thus understanding what controls changing sea level is key to guide society?s response and to promote responsible public

worlds within our solar system (including mars, europa, ganymede, and enceladus). further, with an ever-increasing catalog of worlds detected around stars outside of our solar system, we are studying how to look for life on worlds beyond our solar system.\n\nthis course will address questions that are fundamental to astrobiology, including: what is life? what are the physical and chemical requisites for life as we know it? were these requisites present on other worlds in the past, or are they present today? how do we look for signs of past or present life on other worlds? to help address these questions, students will learn the basic principles of astronomy (star formation, planetary accretion), geology (planetary composition, geologic time, plate tectonics, preservation of biosignatures), chemistry (elements and reactions essential to life, chemical signatures life produces), and biology (metabolism, chemotrophy, phototrophy, biological innovation).\n\nstudents will

environmental issues surrounding urban and agricultural groundwater water quality and use are a primary focus. we will be using the underlying scientific principles of geology, hydrology, biology, and chemistry of karst and cave systems in order to more clearly grapple with these environmental issues. we will examine the current limitations of our technologies to model groundwater flow in complex cave and karst environments, and discuss the ramifications of these limitations on the development of reasonable zoning regulations, agricultural practices, and groundwater quality criteria. additionally, this course aims to show that caves have often acted as inhabited places throughout history (even in modern times) and may contain cultural (archaeological) resources worthy of protection. finally, this course hopes to encourage an appreciation for the roles that caves and karst play in modern society as gas and groundwater reservoirs, the latter of which can be compromised by the migration of contaminated waters. students will read peer-reviewed research to identify for themselves the environmental issues facing caves and karst and to begin to propose their own

(ojibwe for wild rice) is minnesota’s beloved state grain, and it plays a central role in both the diet and cultural identity of many native peoples around the great lakes.  manoomin/wild rice is an aquatic grass that grows naturally in shallow lakes and streams, but unfortunately, due to its high sensitivity to various environmental stressors (e.g., perturbed water levels, contaminants, competitive and invasive species, and climate change), it has been experiencing progressive declines across the region.  this has been alarming for native and non-native people for whom manoomin/wild rice holds special meaning.  \n\nin this course, students will gain an interdisciplinary perspective on how multiple components of the environment, as well as people’s relationships and actions with it, together influence the health of manoomin/wild rice stands.  understanding what supports manoomin/wild rice requires a look at local lake to greater watershed-scale conditions; interacting ecological, hydrological, geochemical, and geological processes; and different environmental management approaches driven by diverse values.  while manoomin/wild rice has served as a flashpoint between tribes and industries that impair their environment, we will learn how it can also become a rallying point for indigenous knowledge-holders and conventional academic scientists to share different worldviews, for tribal and non-tribal policy-makers to collaboratively manage resources, and for all communities living around manooomin/wild rice waters to be better stewards of the whole environment.\n\nstudents will learn a holistic approach to studying manoomin/wild rice and its environment through readings and exercises that span disciplines.  they will also participate in community-engaged learning activities that integrate perspectives beyond conventional academic cultures that can deepen our understanding of the environment.  there will also be a two-night field trip

short, this course aims to smooth a student?s transition from university to an entry-level position from which they can build a successful and sustainable career. this course is targeted for both upper level undergraduates and graduate students. aspects of the course include:\n\n-detailed discussion of regional stratigraphy, bedrock and glacial geology and how they relate to various industrial applications and environmental issues.\n-examination of state and federal environmental regulations, as well as the phases of environmental impact statements.\n-survey of fundamental investigation techniques (geoprobe drilling, hollow-stem auger drilling, well installation, analytical testing ? soil, groundwater, air).\n-introduction to environmental clean-up grants and their management.\n-assessment of topics covered in the national association of state boards of geology (asbog) fundamentals of geology (fg) exam. this exam is a required step on the way to becoming a registered geologist. the exam is offered in mid-march, and the expectation is that students participating in the class will take it. \n-coordination and completion of the 40 hour hazwoper training through umn.\n-invited lectures from select representatives of various subfields and professional organizations (groundwater & contaminant hydrogeology, mining & geophysical exploration, environmental

simplifications and assumptions involved in their applications. geodynamic problems to be discussed include plate cooling, lithospheric deformation, mantle convection, shear (viscous and frictional) heating, subduction, faulting, and their effects on the earth’s thermochemical structures, geoid and topography, and the distributions of earthquakes and volcanism. analytical solutions and numerical models of simple geodynamic problems are introduced, and recent applications of complex geodynamic models to explain geological, geophysical, and geochemical observations are discussed based on

Geochem analysis","info":"chemical analysis of natural samples is essential not only in geochemical research but nearly all other subfields of earth and environmental science research today. some analytical capability routine to geochemists, such as high precision isotope analysis, has also found potential applications in many other disciplines. outside academia, chemical analysis is fundamental to many activities directly relevant to our everyday life, ranging from pollution monitoring to soil testing. with the explosion of analytical capability and increasing applications of geochemical analysis, there is greater need for students in earth and environmental sciences to get familiarized with some common analytical instruments and to grasp some fundamental principles of analytical chemistry. this course will introduce several modern analytical equipment with a particular focus on plasma source mass spectrometers, as well as important techniques developed for precise and accurate analysis of geological and environmental samples. during this course, students will have access to some of the most advanced analytical equipment in geochemical research and gain hands-on experience during in-class lab practice. the lab practice is primarily designed to illustrate some key concepts covered in lectures, rather than a comprehensive training on instrument operation. at the end of this course, students are expected to be capable of critically evaluating geochemical data and master a set of analytical skills that can serve their future careers in research or other chemical analysis related professions. this course is designed to be accessible to students with limited prior analytical experiences.","prereqInfo":"uisites recommended to attend this course are phys
