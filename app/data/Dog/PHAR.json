Despite an improved life expectancy for all races and ethnicities, inequities in morbidity and mortality rates and utilization of preventative and necessary health care services persist for various segments of the population. As the United States’ population becomes increasingly diverse, pharmacists are becoming progressively more responsible for the health care management of people from various races, ethnicities, languages and cultures. Providing culturally and linguistically competent health care to these patients has the potential to reduce ever important disparities in health and health care services and to improve the nation’s overall health outcomes. \n",
