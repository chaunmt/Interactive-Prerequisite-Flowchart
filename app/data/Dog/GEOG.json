Human-induced increases in greenhouse gases are widely thought to be responsible for increasing atmospheric temperatures with cascading effects on quality of life, water scarcity, biodiversity, security, and rising sea levels. This seminar explores the science behind climate change and its current and future impacts on Minnesota. The seminar also uses the subject matter as a vehicle to introduce college freshmen to critical thinking and writing. My approach teaching considers the impacts of a changing climate on Minnesota while developing specific skills students need to excel at the University of Minnesota. Of particular importance is the development of critical thinking skills needed to weigh the arguments of a complex and crucial topic often argued in the twenty-four hour news cycle, blogosphere, or on social media. This course assumes no prior knowledge of climate science and will be presented at a level appropriate to a first-year student at the University of Minnesota.",

    "info": "Technology has significantly improved lives across the globe: we have seen the cost of goods fall due to mass production; people have become more connected through revolutionary developments in transport and electronic communication; health has improved through better sanitation, pharmaceuticals, and surgical techniques. Yet there are still challenges for the future in terms of feeding a growing world population and coming to terms with climate changes.The solutions will be through new developments, innovations, in bio-, nano-, info-, and energy-technologies. These are already bringing benefits but also possible risks. For example, the benefits of genetic engineering for improved food security are obvious and yet there is a fear that it will lead to   ?frankenfoods?.  Similarly, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to take over boring and repetitive jobs in the work place but in so doing could put millions out of work, and some even fear robots threatening human existence. This seminar will examine the idea that living with innovation depends on developing policies that properly manage risks in an informed way, by trying to anticipate and assess them rather than just to avoid them. Risk assessment is a scientific approach that combines an understanding of threat, exposure and vulnerability ? recognizing uncertainties in all the elements ? to estimate the likelihood of impacts.Risk management policy often has to balance the risks from emerging technologies with their benefits. Historically the risks that have arisen from innovation have been small compared with benefits so decisions have been relatively easy. However, some of the risks from the new generation of emerging technologies have potentially big consequence, e.g. in the development of bioweapons, misuse of geo-engineering to unilaterally alter climate, cyberwar, and killer robots. These present special challenges for policy to ensure that we enjoy the benefits of the technology while keeping catastrophic threats acceptably low ? and will form a basis of small group discussions as part of the seminar. An underlying message from the seminar will be that making the right connections between science and policy is a key part of living with innovation.",

The crisis we are witnessing at the U.S.-Mexico border is not new and is historically rooted in U.S. imperialism and colonialism. Yet, Latinx migrants continue to move, live and collectively organize to build a more socially just world across U.S. cities. \n\nThis seminar will examine the multifaceted dimensions of the Latinx urban experience in the U.S., with a special focus on the Twin Cities context. Drawing on diverse scholarship across urban geography, Latinx Studies and feminist theory, we will explore why Latinx people are here? What challenges they face? How they make home across and beyond borders? And how they mobilize for social justice in the city? Students will have the opportunity to learn from local Latinx community-based organizations working on various issues from migrant rights, housing justice and food justice. Students will also have the opportunity to go on several field trips to learn about Latinx life and activism in the Twin Cities. ",

Co-taught by Queen Quet, the Chieftess and Head of State of the Gullah/Geechee Nation and Kate Derickson, faculty in Geography and long time collaborator of Queen Quet’s, this course will explore the thorny challenges at the intersection of cultural heritage and environmental change by engaging with the case of the Gullah/Geechee people. \n\nThe Gullah/Geechee people are descended from freed and escaped enslaved Africans brought to the Southeast coast and the Sea Islands in part due to their knowledge of agriculture to be enslaved on rice, cotton, and indigo plantations. Today, many Gullah/Geechee people still live on the same land that their ancestors were enslaved on. Their ancestors bought this land during Reconstruction and continued to practice traditional farming and it and traditional fishing in the surrounding waterways. The Gullah/Geechee culture is inextricably tied to the land and the water of the Sea Islands and the coast, a connection that has to be accounted for in efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change and inform future planning and community development in the region.\n\nStudents will spend the course in a virtual “studio” setting on campus once weekly - learning, discussing, and exploring the history and culture of the Gullah/Geechee people and the causes and consequences of environmental change in the region. We will also explore different models, ethics, and approaches to engaged scholarship. Students will be divided into groups with a region of Gullah/Geechee Nation to focus on. Each group will produce a StoryMap with archival data, photos, and other relevant data and information collected during and after the field trip. Training in building StoryMaps will be provided.

In this class, we will explore the kind of social and technological innovations and transformations that have made the American present. We will look at how the decisions of the past have shaped both the possibilities and problems of the present in order to help us grapple with the complexities of building the kinds of futures we want to live in. Rather than approaching this as an inevitable story of triumphant progress, we will pay attention to the erasures, exploitation, and violence that were part of these transformations. It is only through grappling with these complexities that we can work towards a future that works.\n\nThis course is designed for any student who is interested in making sense of the country we live in and feels invested in its future. Through the use of case studies, we will explore some of the essential issues facing modern America including immigration and sense of place, agriculture, and water in the Great Plains and the American West, and the intertwined future of American urbanism and the automobile industry as well as a few others. Students can expect to build skills in integrative thinking as they explore problems at the intersection of a variety of human and natural systems as well as an appreciation for how complexity shapes the production of and solution for contemporary socio-environmental problems.\n",

Central Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Anatolia (Turkey) came under the sway of Islam leading to the emergence of three major Islamic civilization that dominated and enlightened the old world for several centuries. This era came to an end with the rise of Capitalist Europe and its colonization of much of the world including Muslim societies. Like many colonized peoples, Muslims threw the yoke of colonialism and joined the postcolonial World. Beyond this historical geographic survey, the course examines the Muslim World’s relationships with the West, democracy, and development.

As we try and maintain social distance from other bodies, wear masks to disrupt the virus’ pathways of diffusion, confront shortages in grocery stores, home supply outlets, and car dealerships, adjust to interruptions in many services, and either choose to, or are forced to stay at home, in our cities, in our countries, we are thinking and acting spatially. And we are reminded that “stuff”—food, medicines, toilet paper—reaches us often through geographically extensive and logistically intricate webs of economic production and distribution.\n\nWe will learn what it means to think geographically about the capitalist economy as a spatial, relational formation. In doing so, we will challenge dominant ways of understanding and analyzing the economy, and of what counts as economic. We will also examine two simultaneous aspects of the world economy—fixity and flow. On the one hand, the economy propels and is propelled by flows—of goods, of services, of people, of labor, and of finance. On the other hand, physical infrastructures are rooted in place on the earth. After all, even the digital worlds of Facebook, Google, and Amazon are enabled by vast server farms. The course will also highlight the production and proliferation of inequalities—between social groups, states, countries, and regions—in and by the world economy. In fact, we will ask: Is economic unevenness a mere byproduct of capitalist economic growth, or the condition of possibility for it? Finally, we will discuss the relationships between global phenomena and local events. Crises like global climate change, overflows of waste matter, COVID19, and the 2008 financial meltdown make it clear that the global and the local are intimately entangled.

    "info": "Why is music so central to the life of the city? Throughout the ages, throughout the world, music seems to have a special power to fill urban space with meaning. This is mostly why the music industry is always desperately trying to chase the new ways music is produced and consumed. Much about the rapid changes in the industry can be linked to changes taking place in the geography of cities and globalization. Through music, people feel connected to landscapes,  neighborhoods, buildings, and identities. Music gives value to places, so helps cement us/them divisions, a process easily seen (heard) in national anthems. This course tries to understand how the interplay exactly occurs between sounds, places, and differences through case studies from many genres. The course makes use of a large range of media and learning styles. Themes include the transnational circuits of reggae, the class backgrounds of punk, Motown and civil rights, psychedelic counterculture, underground electronic music, and the ambivalent identities of Minneapolis's very own Prince.",

Conceptualizing the environment as composed of “systems” (as in the course name) is a common framework in the environmental sciences because it puts the focus on interactions and connections. The “systems” we focus on in this class are the atmosphere (climate), the hydrosphere (water), the biosphere (plants), and the geosphere (land), along with their connections with human activities and decision making.\n\nWe approach the study of environmental systems through the lens of global climate change, which has the potential for far-reaching consequences that extend across environmental systems. You'll recognize how climate processes lead to the spatial patterns of climate that influence human activity (e.g., agriculture, recreation) and infrastructure (e.g., levees, building codes). You'll also learn how soils, landforms, and ecosystems affect and are affected by changes in climate and by decisions humans make about how to live on, and use, the land. Achieving consensus among us as to what should be done in response to environmental change (whether or not those changes are caused by humans) is not a goal of this course; rather, the goal is for you to feel equipped to critically evaluate the range of potential solutions, trade offs, and ethical questions that surround environmental issues.\n\nYou’ll practice what you learn in this course by writing a “consultant report” on the likely impacts of climate change on the human and environmental systems of a location of your choosing. You’ll draw on scholarly research, government documents, and your own analyses to create your report, which is written for a non-expert audience. This kind of writing is a common expectation of environmental scientists, consultants, or policymakers. A series of focused “writing workshops” will support the research and writing process and the development of your final consultant report.",

How is this location related to other locations and its surrounding environments? Through these observations and research questions the process will guide students in building not only curiosity and better focused exploration and investigation of the landscape, but it will lead into the skill of building a hypothesis and answering a research question.\nStudents carry out a variety of field measurements, identification, and analysis of environmental/geographic information to demonstrate how to solve environmental problems and make reasoned decisions. This hands-on course, through the circle of scientific logic process, introduces and implements field research techniques used in environmental and geographical sciences. Emphasis is placed on both theoretical and practical application of fundamental field methods.\nThis course supports the integration of geospatial technologies for field research measurements. Geospatial technologies are a range of modern tools supporting geographic research, mapping, and analysis. Geospatial technologies are comprised of techniques such as Geographic Information System (GIS), Remote Sensing (RS), and Global Positioning System (GPS).

    "info": "Examination of past landscape histories are critical for assessing how environments change and identifying causal mechanisms. Tree-rings, the annual growth rings formed by trees growing in temperate regions, are an instrumental tool for elucidating changes over time. As biological entities, tree-rings are recorders of changes in their surroundings. The application of tree-rings to understand environmental change is called dendrochronology. Dendrochronology has played an important role in understanding past climates, disturbance regimes, and the history of Indigenous peoples (to name just a few applications). Its use has been critical to understanding pressing environmental issues such as 20th century global warming, the impacts of fire suppression on forested landscapes, the loss of the Black Forest in Europe (pollution), and the use/abandonment of archaeological sites (the Anasazi and Ojibwe). It is an exceedingly interesting analytical tool that has unique applications, but it isn’t as simple as counting the rings of trees to determine an age. In this course we will focus on the biology, theoretical principles, and operational techniques of dendrochronology and apply this knowledge toward understanding forest change. By the end of the course students will be able to conduct basic dendrochronological research and appreciate the advantages and limitations of this important tool. My aim is to expose you to the foundational science behind the field, provide you with some simple tools, and introduce you to the variety of applications to which tree-ring analysis can be applied by doing some dendrochronological research. We will apply the tools of dendrochronology toward understanding forest dynamics in a specific landscape to examine fire and tree growth patterns and the influence of climate and people on the forested environment. This course will be a mixture of lecture and hands-on data analysis. The primary approach for this course is the development of a group research project utilizing data that is either collected in the field for a specific purpose or the use of data that is already archived. \n\nprereq: [1403, [BIOL 1001 or BIOL 1009 or equiv]] or instr consent",

    "info": "This course provides a basic foundation in environmental science and global change. Conceptualizing the environment as composed of “systems” (as in the course name) is a common framework in the environmental sciences because it puts the focus on interactions and connections. The “systems” we focus on in this class are the atmosphere (climate), the hydrosphere (water), the biosphere (plants), and the geosphere (land), along with their connections with human activities and decision-making.\n\nWe approach the study of environmental systems through the lens of global climate change, which has the potential for far-reaching consequences that extend across environmental systems. You'll recognize how climate processes lead to the spatial patterns of climate that influence human activity (e.g., agriculture, recreation) and infrastructure (e.g., levees, building codes). You'll also learn how soils, landforms, and ecosystems affect and are affected by changes in climate and by decisions humans make about how to live on, and use, the land. Achieving consensus among us as to what should be done in response to environmental change (whether or not those changes are caused by humans) is not a goal of this course; rather, the goal is for you to feel equipped to critically evaluate the range of potential solutions, trade offs, and ethical questions that surround environmental issues.\n\nYou’ll practice what you learn in this course by writing a “consultant report” on the likely impacts of climate change on the human and environmental systems of a location of your choosing. You’ll draw on scholarly research, government documents, and your own analyses to create your report, which is written for a non-expert audience. This kind of writing is a common expectation of environmental scientists, consultants, or policymakers. A series of focused “writing workshops” will support the research and writing process and the development of your final consultant report.\n\nprereq: grad student or instr consent",

    "info": "Examination of past landscape histories are critical for assessing how environments change and identifying causal mechanisms. Tree-rings, the annual growth rings formed by trees growing in temperate regions, are an instrumental tool for elucidating changes over time. As biological entities, tree-rings are recorders of changes in their surroundings. The application of tree-rings to understand environmental change is called dendrochronology. Dendrochronology has played an important role in understanding past climates, disturbance regimes, and the history of Indigenous peoples (to name just a few applications). Its use has been critical to understanding pressing environmental issues such as 20th century global warming, the impacts of fire suppression on forested landscapes, the loss of the Black Forest in Europe (pollution), and the use/abandonment of archaeological sites (the Anasazi and Ojibwe). It is an exceedingly interesting analytical tool that has unique applications, but it isn’t as simple as counting the rings of trees to determine an age. In this course we will focus on the biology, theoretical principles, and operational techniques of dendrochronology and apply this knowledge toward understanding forest change. By the end of the course students will be able to conduct basic dendrochronological research and appreciate the advantages and limitations of this important tool. My aim is to expose you to the foundational science behind the field, provide you with some simple tools, and introduce you to the variety of applications to which tree-ring analysis can be applied by doing some dendrochronological research. We will apply the tools of dendrochronology toward understanding forest dynamics in a specific landscape to examine fire and tree growth patterns and the influence of climate and people on the forested environment. This course will be a mixture of lecture and hands-on data analysis. The primary approach for this course is the development of a group research project utilizing data that is either collected in the field for a specific purpose or the use of data that is already archived. \n\nprereq: [1403, [BIOL 1001 or BIOL 1009 or equiv]] or instr consent",

CyberGIS, broadly defined as cyberinfrastructure-based geographic information systems, integrates cyberinfrastructure, geographic information systems (GIS), and spatial analysis to enable collaborative geographic problem solving.\n\nThis course will delve into advanced topics within the context of cyberGIS and related technologies. Particular emphasis will be placed on raster data processing including a broad introduction to raster data, cartographic modeling, and raster data manipulation. We will situate raster data processing in the broader context of geographic information science and cyberGIS focusing on the how synthesizing computational thinking and spatial thinking influence methodological approaches. \n\nStudents will be expected to draw on their own experiences and backgrounds to enhance\ndiscussions, labs, and research projects. Students will gain hands-on experience developing methods to analyze and manipulate raster data.\n",

Examples include hurricanes, animal migrations, spread of diseases, human mobility and population dynamics. Movement is a key to understanding the underlying mechanisms of these dynamic processes. Today, the availability of an unprecedented amount of movement observations at ne spatial and temporal granularities has resulted in substantial advances in GISciences approaches for the analysis, modeling, and simulation of movement and its patterns. Spatiotemporal models and simulation techniques are often used to analyze and better understand the patterns of spatiotemporal processes, and to assess their behavioral responses in varying environmental conditions. This seminar introduces students to the concepts of spatiotemporal processes and patterns. We review existing methods for modeling and simulation of spatiotemporal phenomena, especially movement. Students will develop computational skills to model a phenomena of their choice and create simulations.",
