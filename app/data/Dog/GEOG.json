This seminar explores the science behind climate change and its current and future impacts on Minnesota. The seminar also uses the subject matter as a vehicle to introduce college freshmen to critical thinking and writing. My approach teaching considers the impacts of a changing climate on Minnesota while developing specific skills students need to excel at the University of Minnesota. Of particular importance is the development of critical thinking skills needed to weigh the arguments of a complex and crucial topic often argued in the twenty-four hour news cycle, blogosphere, or on social media. This course assumes no prior knowledge of climate science and will be presented at a level appropriate to a first-year student at the University of Minnesota.",

    "info": "Technology has significantly improved lives across the globe: we have seen the cost of goods fall due to mass production; people have become more connected through revolutionary developments in transport and electronic communication; health has improved through better sanitation, pharmaceuticals, and surgical techniques. Yet there are still challenges for the future in terms of feeding a growing world population and coming to terms with climate changes.\nThe solutions will be through new developments, innovations, in bio-, nano-, info-, and energy-technologies. These are already bringing benefits but also possible risks. For example, the benefits of genetic engineering for improved food security are obvious and yet there is a fear that it will lead to   “frankenfoods”.  Similarly, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to take over boring and repetitive jobs in the work place but in so doing could put millions out of work, and some even fear robots threatening human existence. \nThis seminar will examine the idea that living with innovation depends on developing policies that properly manage risks in an informed way, by trying to anticipate and assess them rather than just to avoid them. Risk assessment is a scientific approach that combines an understanding of threat, exposure and vulnerability – recognizing uncertainties in all the elements – to estimate the likelihood of impacts.\nRisk management policy often has to balance the risks from emerging technologies with their benefits. Historically the risks that have arisen from innovation have been small compared with benefits so decisions have been relatively easy. However, some of the risks from the new generation of emerging technologies have potentially big consequence, e.g. in the development of bioweapons, misuse of geo-engineering to unilaterally alter climate, cyberwar, and killer robots. These present special challenges for policy to ensure that we enjoy the benefits of the technology while keeping catastrophic threats acceptably low – and will form a basis of small group discussions as part of the seminar. \nAn underlying message from the seminar will be that making the right connections between science and policy is a key part of living with innovation.\n",

Their ancestors bought this land during Reconstruction and continued to practice traditional farming and it and traditional fishing in the surrounding waterways.

In doing so, we will challenge dominant ways of understanding and analyzing the economy, and of what counts as economic. We will also examine two simultaneous aspects of the world economy—fixity and flow. On the one hand, the economy propels and is propelled by flows—of goods, of services, of people, of labor, and of finance. On the other hand, physical infrastructures are rooted in place on the earth. After all, even the digital worlds of Facebook, Google, and Amazon are enabled by vast server farms. The course will also highlight the production and proliferation of inequalities—between social groups, states, countries, and regions—in and by the world economy. In fact, we will ask: Is economic unevenness a mere byproduct of capitalist economic growth, or the condition of possibility for it? Finally, we will discuss the relationships between global phenomena and local events. Crises like global climate change, overflows of waste matter, COVID19, and the 2008 financial meltdown make it clear that the global and the local are intimately entangled. Not only do global events impact individual livelihoods, including yours and mine, but economic jitters in one place can escalate, sending shockwaves across the world.\n",

The objective of this course is to teach the fundamental theory and quantitative methods within the scope of geospatial analysis. The course starts with basic statistics, matrix, the background of spatial analysis, and exploratory spatial data analysis. Then, we will dive into the special nature of our spatial world, with fundamental geographic ideas and theories being introduced. The focus will be on numerical methods and models including descriptive statistics, pattern analysis, interpolation, and regression models. Finally, some advanced topics regarding spatial complexities and spatial networks will be introduced to arouse further interest in this realm. To sum, this is an introductory course that makes use of quantitative analytics such as linear algebra, statistics, and econometrics for spatial data analysis. By taking this course you will: -quantitatively understand critical concepts behind geospatial processes, such as scale, spatial weights, spatial autocorrelation, spatial dependence, spatial pattern. -learn key methods of analyzing spatial data: e.g., point pattern analysis, spatial autocorrelation statistics, spatial prediction, and spatial regression. -examine the lectured methods/models with data from geographic scenarios using Python and related programming packages.

    "info": "Examination of past landscape histories are critical for assessing how environments change and identifying causal mechanisms. Tree-rings, the annual growth rings formed by trees growing in temperate regions, are an instrumental tool for elucidating changes over time. As biological entities, tree-rings are recorders of changes in their surroundings. The application of tree-rings to understand environmental change is called dendrochronology. Dendrochronology has played an important role in understanding past climates, disturbance regimes, and the history of Indigenous peoples (to name just a few applications). Its use has been critical to understanding pressing environmental issues such as 20th century global warming, the impacts of fire suppression on forested landscapes, the loss of the Black Forest in Europe (pollution), and the use/abandonment of archaeological sites (the Anasazi and Ojibwe). It is an exceedingly interesting analytical tool that has unique applications, but it isn’t as simple as counting the rings of trees to determine an age. In this course we will focus on the biology, theoretical principles, and operational techniques of dendrochronology and apply this knowledge toward understanding forest change. By the end of the course students will be able to conduct basic dendrochronological research and appreciate the advantages and limitations of this important tool. My aim is to expose you to the foundational science behind the field, provide you with some simple tools, and introduce you to the variety of applications to which tree-ring analysis can be applied by doing some dendrochronological research. We will apply the tools of dendrochronology toward understanding forest dynamics in a specific landscape to examine fire and tree growth patterns and the influence of climate and people on the forested environment. This course will be a mixture of lecture and hands-on data analysis. The primary approach for this course is the development of a group research project utilizing data that is either collected in the field for a specific purpose or the use of data that is already archived.

    "info": "Examination of past landscape histories are critical for assessing how environments change and identifying causal mechanisms. Tree-rings, the annual growth rings formed by trees growing in temperate regions, are an instrumental tool for elucidating changes over time. As biological entities, tree-rings are recorders of changes in their surroundings. The application of tree-rings to understand environmental change is called dendrochronology. Dendrochronology has played an important role in understanding past climates, disturbance regimes, and the history of Indigenous peoples (to name just a few applications). Its use has been critical to understanding pressing environmental issues such as 20th century global warming, the impacts of fire suppression on forested landscapes, the loss of the Black Forest in Europe (pollution), and the use/abandonment of archaeological sites (the Anasazi and Ojibwe). It is an exceedingly interesting analytical tool that has unique applications, but it isn’t as simple as counting the rings of trees to determine an age. In this course we will focus on the biology, theoretical principles, and operational techniques of dendrochronology and apply this knowledge toward understanding forest change. By the end of the course students will be able to conduct basic dendrochronological research and appreciate the advantages and limitations of this important tool. My aim is to expose you to the foundational science behind the field, provide you with some simple tools, and introduce you to the variety of applications to which tree-ring analysis can be applied by doing some dendrochronological research. We will apply the tools of dendrochronology toward understanding forest dynamics in a specific landscape to examine fire and tree growth patterns and the influence of climate and people on the forested environment. This course will be a mixture of lecture and hands-on data analysis. The primary approach for this course is the development of a group research project utilizing data that is either collected in the field for a specific purpose or the use of data that is already archived.

    "title": "Spatiotemp Modeling Simulation",
    "info": "Many geographic, societal, and environmental phenomena as well as biological and ecological systems involve dynamic processes that are changing in space and time. Examples include hurricanes, animal migrations, spread of diseases, human mobility and population dynamics. Movement is a key to understanding the underlying mechanisms of these dynamic processes. Today, the availability of an unprecedented amount of movement observations at ne spatial and temporal granularities has resulted in substantial advances in GISciences approaches for the analysis, modeling, and simulation of movement and its patterns. Spatiotemporal models and simulation techniques are often used to analyze and better understand the patterns of spatiotemporal processes, and to assess their behavioral responses in varying environmental conditions. This seminar introduces students to the concepts of spatiotemporal processes and patterns. We review existing methods for modeling and simulation of spatiotemporal phenomena, especially movement. Students will develop computational skills to model a phenomena of their choice and create simulations.",
