        "info": "It’s a microbial world. We are just living in it.\nThis statement by Professor Mark Martin could not be more relevant than it is today. In every aspect of life, microbes play a role. This is particularly true in agricultural practices used to grow food for the human population. Good and bad, microbes are intricately linked to the practice of raising meat, fruits, and vegetables for human consumption.\n\nThe purpose of this online course is to emphasize the holobiont, which is the host itself plus the assemblage of microbes living inside and outside of it. This is different than your typical microbiology course. Yes, we will cover the basics of microbiology, and the role of the microbiome in the maintenance of health and disease. But we will also put this information in the context of ecology. Using the poultry production environment as an example, you will learn about the basics of poultry production and how microbes contribute to every aspect of the production chain - including the bird itself, the barns that birds are grown in, the ecosystem surrounding these barns, the processing plants that produce our meat, and even “us” as we interface with live production animals and consume their meat. In practical terms, this course will train you to appreciate and understand how normal “commensal” microbes in the animal and its surrounding environment are important for everyday life, health, and success. This course is suitable for upper-level undergraduate students, graduate students, and non-traditional industry professionals.",

        "info": "In 2015, an avian influenza virus was introduced to poultry production in the upper Midwestern United States. This outbreak resulted in the destruction of more than 43 million chickens and turkeys raised for meat and egg production, devastating these poultry industries. This changed our view of biosecurity forever as it related to protecting the poultry supply. While this virus has subsided, we do not know where or when the next threat will emerge, and as such we need to be prepared for the unknown. The purpose of this course is to provide the principles of biosecurity, with an emphasis on poultry production. This course will cover the basics of biosecurity, and the role of everyone in the maintenance of biosecurity in commercial broiler chickens, turkeys, and egg layers. You will learn about biosecurity and will learn how to develop an effective biosecurity plan while navigating regulations and other logistical challenges. This online course is suitable for upper-level undergraduate students, graduate students, and non-traditional industry professionals.",
