including the bird itself, the barns that birds are grown in, the ecosystem surrounding these barns, the processing plants that produce our meat, and even “us” as we interface with live production animals and consume their meat. in practical terms, this course will train you to appreciate and understand how normal “commensal” microbes in the animal and its surrounding environment are important for everyday life, health, and success. this course is suitable for upper-level undergraduate students, graduate students, and non-traditional industry professionals.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"POUL 5102","subject":"POUL","id":"5102","title":"How safe is your chicken?","info":"the purpose of this course is to provide introduction to food safety with emphasis on poultry production. an emphasis will be given to understanding the major pathogens transmitted through live poultry and products and how they can be controlled or mitigated in live production and processing steps. after completing this course, you will have understanding of the basic food safety principles, major foodborne pathogens in poultry, principles of hazard analysis and critical control points (haccp)-approach of food safety, meat and egg safety, and major preharvest and post-harvest approaches to safety of poultry foods. this course is suitable for upper-level undergraduate students, graduate students, and non-traditional industry professionals.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"POUL 5103","subject":"POUL","id":"5103","title":"Poultry biosecurity","info":"in 2015, an avian influenza virus was introduced to poultry production in the upper midwestern united states. this outbreak resulted in the destruction of more than 43 million chickens and turkeys raised for meat and egg production, devastating these poultry industries. this changed our view of biosecurity forever as it related to protecting the poultry supply. while this virus has subsided, we do not know where or when the next threat will emerge, and as such we need to be prepared for the unknown. the purpose of this course is to provide the principles of biosecurity, with an emphasis on poultry production. this course will cover the basics of biosecurity, and the role of everyone in the maintenance of biosecurity in commercial broiler chickens, turkeys, and egg layers. you will learn about biosecurity and will learn how to develop an effective biosecurity plan while navigating regulations and other logistical challenges. this online course is suitable for upper-level undergraduate students, graduate students, and non-traditional industry professionals.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]}]
