    "info": "The focus of this course is an exploration of the creative work of a period of history that remains to this day shrouded in mystery. There are strong parallels between the Medieval era and the present day: It is a time when many live in fear. Power, often wielded tyrannically, lies in the hands of a fortunate few, and those at the bottom of the social pyramid are cowed into submission. The Church, seeking to expand its social control, reinforces that terror through cryptic and troubling iconography. Just as in the present day, fear drives superstitions about\nmarvels and monsters to society’s surface. Yet at the same time, a developing curiosity for the world but also a desire for conquest emerge and encounter the Other. Understanding the context and forces at work in this period will provide students with tools to analyze contemporary societal shifts; in other words, exploring the myths of the past will shed a light on those that govern the present.\n\nDuring the semester, students will discover the mysteries, marvels, and monsters of this period through literature and visual media. The goal will be to study these works from diverse perspectives, but also to see how this imagery and these legends have persisted through the ages to the present day (for example Victor Hugo’s 19th-Century romantic poetry and Alexandre Astier’s popular 21st-Century series Kaamelott). Students will explore changes in the literature from the past to the present (theater, poetry, prose) as well as architecture and\nthe arts in an attempt to access a deeper comprehension of this often misunderstood time that can inform our understanding of the present.\n\nThis is a writing-intensive course, offering a broad introduction to the critical methods, standards of scholarship, and body of knowledge specific to the discipline of French and francophone studies. The course will train students to understand and analyze texts and visual media, including sculpture, painting, manuscript illuminations, and film. Since it is writing intensive, particular attention is given to the content, style, and format of written assignments.",

From the Middle Ages to the present day in such popular works as George RR Martin’s Game of Thrones, the myths and folklore surrounding the king have been ceaselessly renewed. Beginning with the pseudo-historical origins of Arthur and his knights in the old French literary tradition as depicted by Chrétien de Troyes and in iconic works of the matière de Bretagne, and ending with Alexandre Astier’s wildly popular television series, Kaamelott, this course will seek to shed light on the popularity and the mystery surrounding le roi Arthur. Over the course of the semester we will explore the legendary material in detail, constantly comparing and contrasting contemporary works with their Medieval forbears with the ultimate goal of understanding how these creations function within a socio-cultural framework.",

Students will examine key moments in France’s history that have left a mark: the period of Nazi occupation and the conflict between collaborators and resistance fighters (as portrayed in Louis Malle’s Au Revoir les Enfants, Jacques Audiard’s Un Héros très discret or Joseph Losey’s Mr. Klein), France’s departure from Indochina (Pierre Schoendorffer’s Diên Biên Phu), the Algerian war (Gillo Pontecorvo’s La Bataille d’Alger), the cultural revolution of May 1968 (Ducastel and Martineau’s Nés en 68), evolving family models and changing visions of socialism in the 1980s (Pinoteau’s La Boum), social upheaval and exclusion in the 1990s (Kassovitz’s La Haine, Lisa Azulos’s LOL, Mounia Meddour’s Papicha). Recent film and text will engage with an exploration of contemporary France (the 2000s and 2010s) around issues such francophone multiculturalism, societal unrest (the yellow-jacket movement) and the terror attacks (Audiard’s Un Prophète, Ladj Ly’s Les Misérables, Houda Benyamina’s Divines, Emmanuel Leconte’s Humour à mort— the Charlie Hebdo attacks), but also France’s continuing mission to promote the arts and humanities and make them accessible to every socioeconomic corner of the population (e.g., through nationwide events such as the annual Fête du Cinéma, the Journées du Patrimoine, and once-a-month free access to museums).

The course aims to address the main issues surrounding the intensive human use of the environment to be able to provide a growing population with healthy food in a sustainable way. We?ll be paying special attention to water use, soil management, loss of biological diversity, and the challenges posed by global climate change.\n\nGlobal food production poses the greatest threat to natural ecosystems and is the largest driver of environmental degradation. Therefore, the course will help students understand, reflect on, and analyze some of the ways the Mediterranean food production system in the south of France is responding to these challenges. It will focus on the three main geographical areas surrounding Montpellier: the lagoons, coastal plains, and mountains, as well as the main productive activities of each ecosystem. By focusing on the current technical innovations proposed for the region?s food system development, students will be able to explore some of the main solutions currently proposed to tackle the need to produce food while conserving the natural environment and the region?s cultural heritage.",

Students are expected to master basic linguistic concepts to analyze second\nlanguage productions through the study of their linguistic components. In addition, this course provides an introduction to second language acquisition theories, with attention being given to both child and adult learners. Major debates within the field of second language learning will be discussed and their implications for classroom-based language teaching will be explored. These include the role of implicit and explicit learning mechanisms and teaching approaches, the impact of age of acquisition, the role of learning context, and the impact of individual differences on second language acquisition. In addition, this course will devote time to exploring certain aspects of language learning in the European context, notably with respect to evaluation (CEFR) and as concerns plurilingualism initiatives that have been pursued in the French education system.\n\nIn addition, a component of this course will explore the importance of incorporating culture in second language teaching and highlight the crucial interaction between language and culture in the classroom. Students will acquire tools for developing lesson plans that incorporate culture and promote cross-cultural comprehension.",

Is that even a valid question? What are the origins of the French, and specifically how might a work of literature or a film reveal the various dimensions of their cultural identity? With these questions in mind, the first third of the course focuses on the history of immigration in France and the complex nature of the issue as it stands at the beginning of the 21st Century. The second third of the course is centered on mainland France, with a particular focus on those regions and populations asserting claims of independence (Pays Basque, La Corse, la Bretagne) or with strong cultural identities; we will also examine the role of minority languages, and a selection of literary works and films will serve to illustrate some of the distinctive features of each region. A similar approach will be used in the final part of the course, which will examine the rich diversity of the francophone world, and consider its influence on France’s pluralistic identity.\nThis is a writing-intensive course, offering a broad introduction to the critical methods, standards of scholarship, and body of knowledge specific to the discipline of French and francophone studies. The course will train students to understand and analyze texts and visual media, including sculpture, painting, manuscript illuminations, and film. Since it is writing intensive, particular attention is given to the content, style, and format of written assignments.",

    "title": "Writing in French: Tools, Tchn",
    "info": "This class is designed to introduce students to the techniques and tools required for both academic and personal writing. Over the course of the semester, students will learn how to write a variety of different types of texts including: the description, the compte rendu universitaire, the journalistic portrait, and other textual genres. The course consists of an analytic component in which students will be asked to study a text corresponding to a specific style. Students are then asked to explore the writing techniques employed in each type: reformulation, synthesis, rhetorical figures, persuasive language, expressing an opinion via judgment or values, impersonal language, inverted questioning of the reader, etc. and subsequently write in those styles.\n\nStudents will be expected to complete numerous writing assignments during the semester. These exercises will be collected and graded on a regular basis, with the possibility for students to revise and improve each project. Course objectives include: learning how to write different types of documents, with different content, using different styles, applying the knowledge acquired in the grammar/methodology course, mastering the stylistic tools and techniques for writing in French (e.g., the use of hyperbole, metaphor, personification, diction, symbolism) acquiring the ability to think in French and write directly in the target language without translating.",

Students will have a closer look at French charity organization, NGO, and see how they work here in France. They will also examine leadership values in their country and see how they can adapt and develop them in their new environment. \n\nThis course and students' engagement in the community will deepen their understanding of the host country cultural context and will lead them to critically examine their own worldviews. Topics explored will include ethic and social responsibility, leadership, French social systems, multiculturalism in the French society, place of secularism (laïcité) in the French society, history of immigration, and gender equality.",
