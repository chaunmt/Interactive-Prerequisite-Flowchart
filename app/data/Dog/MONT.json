    "info": "through the lens of literature, this course explores the changes in french society from the period of the second world war to the present day. beginning with the trauma of the nazi occupation, students will look at how french literature over the years has served as a mirror on society, reflecting cultural, social, and political evolutions. students will examine key moments in france’s history that have left a mark: the period of nazi occupation and the conflict between collaborators and resistance fighters (as portrayed in tatiana de rosnay’s sarah’s key), france in indochina and the underpinnings of its postcolonial legacy (marguerite duras’s sea wall), the cultural revolution of may 1968 (annie ernaux’s the years), evolving family models and changing visions of the world in the 1980s (tahar ben jelloun’s the sand child), social upheaval and exclusion from the 1990s to the present day (edouard louis’s ending eddy, michel houellebecq’s platform, mounia meddour’s papicha). recent texts and film will engage with an exploration of contemporary france around issues such as francophone multiculturalism, societal unrest (the yellow-jacket movement) and the terror attacks (marie n’diaye’s ladivine, jacques’s audiard’s un prophète, ladj ly’s les misérables, emmanuel leconte’s humour à mort—the charlie hebdo attacks), but also france’s continuing mission to promote literature through the prix goncourt. the course aims to provide students with tools for understanding a culture through an exploration of its creative artifacts.
