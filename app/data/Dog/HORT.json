systems. students in this course will learn tools needed to manage an organic diversified vegetable operation. the course consists of two components. the lecture session is designed to help students think about concepts and principles that are useful in planning and managing production strategies on organic farms. we spend a significant amount of our time reviewing soil nutrient cycling and its critical importance for organic farms, including how to effectively use soil and organic nutrient inputs such as cover crops, manure and fertilizers, to provide vegetable crops with the nutrients they need to grow. we also learn about successful marketing strategies for organic produce. finally, near the end of the semester we will discuss pest management, including both weeds and disease/insect pests, and compare different tillage options available to organic producers. what we learn is then applied to planning next year's season of the umn student organic farm. throughout, we will use case studies, guest speakers, games, and active learning discussion approaches to move these classroom sessions \\\"beyond the lecture\\\" and allow students to engage with the material in a meaningful

contrast different production features and challenges. we will explore the specialty crop industry, trends, consumer behavior, and marketing, including organic regulations and certification programs. we will explore fruit and vegetable production within the framework of sustainable agriculture, which encompasses agricultural productivity, economic viability, environmental conservation, and social equity, and how this relates to the regulatory framework supporting organic certification. the format of this class is 70% discussion, 30% lecture.","prereqInfo":"soil 2125 and [hort 1001 or agro 1101
