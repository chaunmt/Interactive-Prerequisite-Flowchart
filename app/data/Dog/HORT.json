You'll explore basic botany, soils and compost, species and variety selection, planning and design, container gardening, pest management, season extension, and more so you can approach your gardening projects with confidence.\n\nWe will begin by taking a look at the fundamentals of organic gardening, then move onto an overview of basic plant science principles. Following this introduction, course content will focus on how these principles can be applied practically in the planning and management of an organic garden, whether that be in your yard, on your patio, or at a school or community site. \n\nThis course isn?t so much about memorizing facts as it is about you becoming a well-informed gardener who can make educated decisions and seek out reliable answers to questions or problems that might come up. \n\nThe course is presented entirely online and makes extensive use of discussions, interactive activities, worksheets, and multimedia projects that get you immersed in a host of gardening topics. Short video segments in each module highlight key topics and provide information to guide you as you work through the readings, activities, and assignments.",

This course aims to increase student's knowledge of ecological concepts as applied to managing organic systems, with an emphasis on soil nutrient cycles and plant-soil-microbe interactions that serve as the cornerstone of organic systems. Students in this course will learn tools needed to manage an organic diversified vegetable operation. The course consists of two components. The lecture session is designed to help students think about concepts and principles that are useful in planning and managing production strategies on organic farms. We spend a significant amount of our time reviewing soil nutrient cycling and its critical importance for organic farms, including how to effectively use soil and organic nutrient inputs such as cover crops, manure and fertilizers, to provide vegetable crops with the nutrients they need to grow. We also learn about successful marketing strategies for organic produce. Finally, near the end of the semester we will discuss pest management, including both weeds and disease/insect pests, and compare different tillage options available to organic producers. What we learn is then applied to planning next year's season of the UMN student organic farm. Throughout, we will use case studies, guest speakers, games, and active learning discussion approaches to move these classroom sessions \\\"beyond the lecture\\\" and allow students to engage with the material in a meaningful way. The lab is designed to allow a space to put into action some of the concepts students learn in lecture, including soil organic matter analysis, microgreen propagation, calculation of organic fertilizer rates, and operation of driven and walk-behind tractors.",

The goal of this course is to provide information of classifying, identifying and applying Herbs and herbal products for human health. This course focuses on the classification and identification of approximately 120 common medicinal plants, which covers 20 key medicinal plant families. With over 50 dry herbal samples being distributed to the class, participants of the class have the opportunity to learn essential skills of identifying and practicing fresh herbs and the processed herbal products. The information of herbal names (English, Chinese, scientific, and pharmaceutical names), morphology, properties (flavors), therapeutic actions, dosages, chemical components and cautions is provided for each herb. In addition, the knowledge of traditional Chinese medicine and herb uses, systems and methods for Chinese herbal classification, identification will also be introduced.

Students will learn how to identify these crops, learn their common and scientific names, and how these plants have adapted physiologically to survive stressful conditions. At least 100 different crops will be covered during this course (approximately 20 per class). Students will be expected to be able to identify these plants from images, whole plants, and/or plant parts. Information will be presented and/or learned using lectures, field trips, exercises, and homework, and a course project.

As spring progresses, different genera and species predominate in the flowering landscape. In contrast, greenhouse production of potted plant and cut flower geophytic crops can be simultaneous rather than sequential. This course will consist of hands-on taxonomic identification of geophyte crops, their uses in landscape design, and production essentials. The course will be hands-on, experiential learning with many visits of outdoor landscape, gardens, production greenhouses, and interiorscapes.\n\nprereq: HORT 1015",

The role of ornamental plants in the human environment will be discussed, with special emphasis on future issues. Writing is an integral component of this course; one major paper is revised and expanded multiple times plus other course writing fulfill the writing intensive requirement.

The course builds on knowledge obtained in Hort 1001 or Hort 1015, by adding in additional factors of plant growth coupled with scheduling and growing a of crops which commercial growers would experience. The role of ornamental plants in the human environment will be discussed, with special emphasis on future issues. Writing is an integral component of this course; one major paper is revised and expanded multiple times plus other course writing fulfill the writing intensive requirement. Through the use of interactive learning, field trips, written assignments, and in-class discussions students learn crop requirements and the interactions between the marketing distribution system of breeders, producers, distributors, growers, retailers, and consumers.\n\nprereq: Graduate student.
