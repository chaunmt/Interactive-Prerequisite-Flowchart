design of products and processes, the procurement of raw materials, the control of inventories, the maintenance of quality, the planning of human resources and facilities, and the delivery of products

(2) ability to ascertain and discover novel behavioral issues that arise within operations contexts, particularly those with the potential for major impact on operational outcomes such as profit, demand, operational efficiency, service level, employee retention, and customer satisfaction; and (3) judgement of what research methodologies are most appropriate for studying a given behavioral issue and practice using these methodologies.  special emphasis is given to  experimental and analytical methodologies, with applications spanning operational decisions in service systems, new product development, supply chain management, and responsible operations.","prereqInfo":"business admin phd student or instr consent;
