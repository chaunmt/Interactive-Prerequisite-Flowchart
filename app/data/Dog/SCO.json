Operational issues include the design of products and processes, the procurement of raw materials, the control of inventories, the maintenance of quality, the planning of human resources and facilities, and the delivery of products or services, so that customer expectations and needs are met. Operations also have significant interactions with other functional areas of the firm (e.g., finance, marketing, strategy, and accounting). Therefore, understanding the role of the operations function and its impact on the competitiveness of the firm from both tactical and strategic aspects is an important part of any manager's training.

While these topics build upon and extend the core focus areas of supply chain operations (e.g., technology management, operations strategy, and inventory management), they also cross disciplinary boundaries (e.g., information systems, strategy, and public policy) and represent areas of much interest to scholars across disciplines.  \nPrereq: Business admin PhD student or instr consent; offered alt yrs","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":{"course":[]}},{"code":"SCO 8831","subject":"SCO","id":"8831","title":"Supply Chain Management","info":"This course is designed to provide students with some foundational tools and techniques to model and analyze business problems in the context of supply chain management. Basic theoretical models as well as related quantitative methods and techniques will be discussed.  In addition, each session will involve detailed discussions of classic and recent research articles that demonstrate how various supply chain topics of interest can be modeled and analyzed using different conceptual and methodological approaches. \nPrereq: Business admin PhD student or instr consent; offered alt yrs","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":{"course":[]}},{"code":"SCO 8832","subject":"SCO","id":"8832","title":"Analytical Models for Ops Mgt","info":"This is a foundational course that introduces PhD students to analytical models widely used in operations management including optimization, game theory, and queueing theory.

It focuses on developing skills in three areas (1) knowledge of classic behavioral theories in economics, sociology, psychology, and other social sciences as they apply to an operations context; (2) ability to ascertain and discover novel behavioral issues that arise within operations contexts, particularly those with the potential for major impact on operational outcomes such as profit, demand, operational efficiency, service level, employee retention, and customer satisfaction; and (3) judgement of what research methodologies are most appropriate for studying a given behavioral issue and practice using these methodologies.  Special emphasis is given to  experimental and analytical methodologies, with applications spanning operational decisions in service systems, new product development, supply chain management, and responsible operations.\nPrereq: Business admin PhD student or instr consent; offered alt yrs","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":{"course":[]}},{"code":"SCO 8842","subject":"SCO","id":"8842","title":"Retail Operations","info":"This course is designed to provide an overview of research in the field of retail operations and to help students develop necessary skills to conduct research in retail operations.

Operations play a central role, as the objective of environmentally- and socially-responsible business needs to be realized through implementation and operationalization on the ground. Over the past decades, operations research has made significant contributions to advance our understanding and approaches on the sustainable aspects, examples include studies on the design and management of closed-loop supply chains (to deal with the resell, reuse, recycling or remanufacturing of used items), the development and implementation of evaluation systems to assess the environmental performance of firms (such as incorporation of the industrial ecology tool of Life-Cycle Assessment into the analysis), the formulation of environmental regulations (ranging from waste management, energy, to emissions and pollutions), the innovative business models (such as different new product development strategies, servicing and sharing economy), and those on the broader social and humanitarian issues. In this course, we will dive into the related literature, to have in-depth discussions on papers that use different conceptual and methodological approaches.\nPrereq: Business admin PhD student or instr consent; offered alt yrs","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":{"course":[]}},{"code":"SCO 8892","subject":"SCO","id":"8892","title":"Readings in Supply Chain & Ops","info":"Readings useful to student's individual program and objectives that are not available in regular courses.","prereqInfo":"prereq: Business admin PhD student or instr consent","prereq":{"course":[]}},{"code":"SCO 8894","subject":"SCO","id":"8894","title":"Research in Supply Chain & Ops","info":"Individual research on an approved topic appropriate to student's program and objectives.","prereqInfo":"prereq: Business admin PhD student or instr consent","prereq":{"course":[]}}]
