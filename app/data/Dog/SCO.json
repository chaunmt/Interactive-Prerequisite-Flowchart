    "info": "Sustainable Supply Chain and Operations Management focuses on the design and management of transformation processes to provide products and services to create value for the people, planet, and firm prosperity. On the one hand, supply chain and operations management involves the integration of activities and processes, to facilitate the flows of materials, services, finances, and information to convert inputs into the firms’ primary products and services. Operational issues include the design of products and processes, the procurement of raw materials, the control of inventories, the maintenance of quality, the planning of human resources and facilities, and the delivery of products or services, so that customer expectations and needs are met. Operations also have significant interactions with other functional areas of the firm (e.g., finance, marketing, strategy, and accounting). Therefore, understanding the role of the operations function and its impact on the competitiveness of the firm from both tactical and strategic aspects is an important part of any manager's training. This course will introduce students to the fundamental concepts, operations practices, and models in both manufacturing- and service-oriented firms. The course will cover both quantitative and qualitative methods.",

    "info": "With the advancement of digital technologies and networking capabilities, firms are actively engaged in capturing “big” data related to their supply chains. Firms recognize the immense potential in mining big data for improving the quality and timeliness of decisions, and becoming proactive in sensing and responding to external and internal signals of threats and opportunities. The course develops the capability to analyze and interpret structured and unstructured data that is fundamental to managing supply. The data analytics methods covered in the course include statistical methods (e.g., multivariate regression, logistics regression, GLMM, LASSO), machine learning methods (e.g., support vector machine, ensemble methods – random forest, gradient boosting model) and optimization methods (e.g., deterministic and stochastic methods). Through a combination of operations analysis case studies and hands-on exercises, students learn (i) various facets of data analytics: data access, data aggregation, data analysis and data visualization; (ii) appropriateness and inappropriateness of big data analytic methods; and (iii) big data based predictive analytics. The final course project involves designing and testing of prototype systems in supply chain and operations settings of companies. ",

The seminar approach is both topical and methodological, using published and working papers as the context and starting point for discussions. Although the focus of the class is not to teach new methods, a significant amount of time will be spent on the theoretical, empirical, and econometric research paradigms used in the papers.

Operations play a central role, as the objective of environmentally- and socially-responsible business needs to be realized through implementation and operationalization on the ground. Over the past decades, operations research has made significant contributions to advance our understanding and approaches on the sustainable aspects, examples include studies on the design and management of closed-loop supply chains (to deal with the resell, reuse, recycling or remanufacturing of used items), the development and implementation of evaluation systems to assess the environmental performance of firms (such as incorporation of the industrial ecology tool of Life-Cycle Assessment into the analysis), the formulation of environmental regulations (ranging from waste management, energy, to emissions and pollutions), the innovative business models (such as different new product development strategies, servicing and sharing economy), and those on the broader social and humanitarian issues.
