Your Canvas posts, reaction papers, assignments, and exams will all require this kind of analysis, which is an essential component of any Liberal Education. But key to a Liberal Education in our globalized society is also the ability to create media products that are respectful and inclusive, which is a skill that you will also acquire during this course by means of tutorials, workshops, and hands-on experiential learning assignments.\n \nSince ITAL1912 deals extensively with the world beyond the United States; requires you to situate Italian and European contemporary histories within the context of global post-war culture, society, and politics; examines issues like racism and sexism through a comparative framework; and invites you to reflect on the shifting relations between media, identity, ideology, and power, it satisfies the requirements for the Global Perspectives Theme.\n \nThis freshman seminar with a study component in Rome in fact will offer you the unique opportunity to embark on an exciting cinematic journey through the city of St Peter’s Basilica, the Colosseum, la dolce vita, and so much more. By watching and discussing the most iconic representations of contemporary Rome in film, and by going to the movies together in Rome, we will learn about Italy’s rich history and culture, but also tackle bigger philosophical and political questions from a global perspective.\n \nWhat is a city? Do cities have identities? How can the vibe of a city be conveyed on screen? How do film & media shape spaces and make places?\n \nBy telling fictional stories about a city, how do movies or television bear witness to - and simultaneously intervene into - real historical dynamics?\n \nHow do movies create connections between people from diverse backgrounds, while also establishing borders within public spaces and hierarchies regarding whom the city belongs to?\n\nBy exposing unseen and unheard stories, by featuring bodies and subjects that media traditionally shuns, can fiction films and documentaries be deployed to favor political change, inclusivity, and diversity?\n \nWe will tackle these questions through screenings, readings, class discussion, on-site visits, guest lectures, practical assignments, experiential activities, tutorials, and masterclasses. Learning from the works, we tackle how to use film & media to foster more welcoming and inclusive arrangements of community and belonging. By the end of the semester, you will have learned why media representation matters for politics and history, while also having acquired the skill-set necessary to capture the complex reality of a city in a way that is conducive to social justice and political progress.\n",

While concentrated largely on residential neighborhoods within the Capital, Rome, the seminar includes a three-day excursion to Matera and Alberobello, the former in the central-southern region of Basilicata and the latter in southeastern Puglia, enabling students to consider the implications of two Southern Italian local economies largely dependent on tourism for survival and ponder the sustainability of each area. The seminar culminates in an extended day-long excursions to Naples, which contains the only continually inhabited city center in Italy, and will present a counter-example to the processes of revitalization and neighborhood transition witnessed in Rome and elsewhere, as well as provide an opportunity to synthesize information gathered thus far and apply it in a different context.",
