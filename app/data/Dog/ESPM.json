This course will use an interdisciplinary case-study approach to expose students to the most important environmental problems facing society today as well as innovative solutions.  The case studies include investigations of ecosystem services, invasive species and pollution remediation, with world experts on these topics leading the discussions.  Throughout, a focus on interdisciplinary analysis, including linkages to environmental grand challenges will be emphasized.

One of the most important groups of pollinators, the bees, contain over 20,000 species. Through a mix of readings, active learning activities and lectures, this course will allow students to learn about the biology, conservation, and importance of pollinators. The first portion of the class will focus on the fascinating biology of pollination and pollinators, including mutualisms, trickery and other complex species interactions. Students will explore the evolutionary biology of plant-pollinator interactions and how the millions of years of interactions between plants and pollinators have led to diverse array of colors, smells and floral forms we see today. The second section of the course will explore actions of pollinators in terms of honey production, crop pollination, economics and cultural appreciation. Students will explore how pollinators contribute to human society and how the actions of humans impact pollinator populations. Both sections will be viewed through a lens of pollinator conservation and environmental policy. Here students will be expected to ability to locate and evaluate scientific information and think critically how science does and does not affect environmental policy.",

Yet we face the challenges of understanding the complexities of this system in order to manage our natural resources and to prepare wisely for the future. This class examines the basic theory and Physics behind the atmospheric greenhouse effect and radiative forcings in the climate system. The Myths, Mysteries, and Uncertainties about the climate record and feedback processes operating in the Earth-Atmosphere system will be examined. Simple models will be used to demonstrate the atmospheric greenhouse effect. Sophisticated numerical weather models, such as the Regional Weather and Forecast Chemistry (WRF-CHEM) model, will be used to demonstrate climate predictions and biophysical feedback processes. We will also study some of the classic Warming Papers that provide the physical scientific basis for the anthropogenic greenhouse effect. Finally, we will explore the uncertainties related to climate predictions and how scientists use fingerprint techniques to diagnose natural versus anthropogenic climate signals. There is no prerequisite required for this course, but first year calculus and one other first year science course is recommended.",

    "title": "Science and Critical Thinking",
    "info": "Today more than ever we must deal with multiple sources of conflicting information on topics that affect our lives in big ways.  We use this information to make important decisions, from major policy decisions to personal lifestyle choices. Understanding complex, high-stakes societal issues such as the global COVID-19 pandemic requires that we rapidly process and synthesize new science that is changing fast, and that we do so in an environment of partisan bias and media spin that make it extremely difficult for citizens to stay informed and make good decisions. The debate surrounding the response to COVID-19, climate change, water policy, and other planetary and human health issues, invoke moral or ethical principles in addition to scientific arguments. As a result, problem solving and decision making requires simultaneously evaluating complex scientific and ethical arguments. Several aspects of human psychology mean that we do not reliably make logical choices when presented with complex information. Furthermore, data and science are frequently used to mislead, from the naïve misuse of statistics to deliberate misinformation campaigns. As a result, weighing evidence and rational decision-making for complex issues requires skepticism, critical thinking, and lots of practice. \n\nIn this course, students will develop critical thinking tools and cultivate scientific skepticism for evaluating claims encountered in peer-reviewed scientific papers, popular press articles, or on social media. Examples and case studies will draw heavily on current events surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and associated societal and environmental responses,  but will also include other environmental, health, and public policy issues to demonstrate the range of ways in which data and science can be used or misused to support a position. To create the necessary habits of mind for skepticism and critical thinking, this course will cover background material from ethics, neurology, behavioral economics, statistics, and logic. We will employ a number of active learning strategies, and class meetings will frequently consist of students actively engaged in processing and understanding course content. \n\nUpon leaving this course students will be able to confidently evaluate the veracity of information as they encounter it in multiple contexts throughout their lives. Students will understand how views of the role of ethics in scientific inquiry have evolved, and the roles of science, uncertainty, and ethics in determining public opinion and policy decisions on environmental topics. Students will learn to identify and recognize misinformation in its various forms and to articulate why a particular piece of information is misleading. We will explore the various ways that our intuition and memory make interpreting data and statistics challenging, and develop tools and habits of mind to overcome these challenges.",
