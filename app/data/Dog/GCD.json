The course is suitable for students who have successfully completed at least one general biology course that included coverage of basic genetics and cell biology. Stem cells are one of the rapidly growing topics in biology. Research into stem cells ranges from basic biology to regeneration to clinical applications to ethics. In this course, you will learn the general features of embryonic, artificial, or adult-tissue stem cells: how they contribute to tissue regeneration, how scientists create and manipulate stem cells, what scientists do with them, what the public considers stem cell research and why. Then, you will learn about bone marrow transplantation, an established stem cell-based therapy, and various diseases and potential applications of stem cells to treat/cure the diseases. By the end of this course, you will have deeper insights into stem cells. Recommended prerequisites: BIOL1009 (General Biology), BIOL1951 (Foundations of Biology Lecture I for Biological Sciences Majors) or an equivalent General Biology course that includes basic coverage of genetics and cell biology This course can NOT be used as an elective for some CBS majors, such as the GCD major.
