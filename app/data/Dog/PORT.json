Due to this myth, known as “racial democracy,” it has been difficult for Brazilian Blacks to identify themselves as such and mobilize for representation and equality of rights.  This course is an introduction to the cultural history of that struggle since the 1930s to the present.  We will follow the emergence of Black voices denouncing the official racial ideology that aimed to “whiten,” exclude and ultimately do away with the reminders (and remainders) of the 5 million African slaves who landed in Brazil between the 16th and 19th centuries.  We will study a variety of materials from literature and the arts, including films, pop music, rap, and graffiti; and will also read short texts from journalism, history, and the social sciences. The course will end with the discussion of how the introduction of affirmative action in Brazilian public universities has encouraged a Black/White form of racial identification that many consider foreign to the dominant ethos (i.e. “we are all mixed”).",

It builds on Spanish-language skills to cover the linguistic content of PORT 1101-1104 in one semester. You will use your developing Portuguese language skills to explore the cultures of various Portuguese-speaking communities via a wealth of authentic materials such as news stories, pop culture magazines, literature, film, and tv. The course simultaneously develops your knowledge of different language structures and your ability to use them in real world contexts.\n\nThis class follows a flipped classroom model, in which the study of grammatical concepts is to be done outside of class. Prior to class, students study the material in the textbook and complete any assigned exercises; in class group exercises are done to practice and apply the new grammatical concepts learned. Since the ultimate goal of the program is for you to communicate in the Portuguese language, actual communication in class will be emphasized. \n\nprereq: SPAN LPE Pass",

At the same time, you will be introduced to indigenous, black, and female voices of resistance and self-affirmation. All writing assignments and discussions are meant to encourage critical, plural thought about such topics as empire, globalization, slavery, colonialism, exclusion, displacement, and belonging.

You will learn about the history of Brazilian film from cinema novo on, with attention to state funding; internationalization; and recurrent themes, such as the sertão or backlands and the favela or shantytown. In the case of Lusophone postcolonial films, you will learn about issues of personal and collective identity, including hybrid, diasporic, and non-heteronormative identities; nation building and post-conflict trauma; memory and healing. The approach is two-fold: cinema as representation of society, history, culture, and the individual subject; and cinema as a complex, multi-layered, and expensive art form. You are expected to critically engage with the form and content of each film as you acquire an understanding of the historical, cultural, (geo)political, and socio-economic forces that have shaped the development of film in the various countries, in addition to the social issues raised by filmmakers. You will also become familiar with philosophical and aesthetic insights from which to critically review a film.

To that end, you will study a number of literary, visual, and musical texts from Portugal, Brazil, and Lusophone Africa featuring empire as fantasy to be fulfilled; violent reality to be denounced, exorcized and rejected, or further mythified; and/or ever returning phantoms unsettling the notion of independence and of the so called transnational turn of globalization. The course is divided into three segments within which readings and viewings will follow a chronological order. First you will learn about the Portuguese empire in India and its present-day remnants in Goa; you will then learn about Brazil's postcolonial development and how the former colony \\\"writes back\\\" to the former metropolis and decrees itself as \\\"the country of the future,\\\" albeit not without the racist heritage of colonialism and the myth of racial democracy; finally, you will learn about decolonization, immigration, and the Africanness of postcolonial Portugal.
