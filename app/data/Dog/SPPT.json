post-emancipation, modern nation-making and whitening; modernism and the ideals of “la raza cósmica” (josé vasconcelos, in mexico) and racial democracy (gilberto freyre, in brazil); the problem of forging a black consciousness in an officially mixed-race nation; and the appropriation of a modernist, mexican notion of “mestizaje” to forge a chicanx identity in the old one-drop rule usa. \n\nclasses will be conducted in english, but students have the option to read some of the originals in portuguese or spanish; sometimes we will cite the originals in class to have students listen to – and hopefully appreciate – the sounds and nuances of portuguese and spanish. classes will be interactive, with a combination of lecture and discussion; oral presentations, viewing of art, music and film clips and discussion thereof; and group activities. depending on students’ language abilities, small group discussions in class can be in spanish, portuguese or english. all texts are considered a valid object of study and discussion, in whatever language and from whatever disciplinary perspective they are written. i have deliberately mixed literature, anthropology, sociology, art history and so-called mass culture in order to expose students to a variety of disciplinary perspectives. the point is to see how insistent notions of ‘race’ are integrally related to the way that nations are imagined and controlled but also appropriated and potentially questioned.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"SPPT 3605","subject":"SPPT","id":"3605","title":"Symbolism/Politics","info":"political upheavals, national liberation movements, and civil wars in spain, latin america, portugal, the portuguese-speaking countries in africa, and the hispanic population in the united states, either individually or in various forms of inter-relations.  political activity and symbolic expression beyond literature. taught in english.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"SPPT 3608","subject":"SPPT","id":"3608","title":"Politics:HispTheat","info":"study of drama as reality and metaphor using traditional, modern, and vanguard plays.  works of cervantes, lope de vega, caldersn, unamuno, valle-inclan, triana, and usigli.  films, videos, attendance of local and touring theatre groups.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"SPPT 3611","subject":"SPPT","id":"3611","title":"Mod LatAmer Writing","info":"a comparative approach to literature of the spanish- and portuguese-speaking americas, including latino writing in the united states.  emphasis on women's writing.  all readings in english. does not count toward spanish or spanish-portuguese major.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"SPPT 5930","subject":"SPPT","id":"5930","title":"Hispanic Cultural Discourse","info":"cultural discourses in spanish- and portuguese-speaking areas. historical intersections/divergences. taught in spanish or portuguese, and in english when cross-listed. topics specified in class schedule.","prereqInfo":"reading knowledge of spanish and portuguese","prereq":[]},{"code":"SPPT 5995","subject":"SPPT","id":"5995","title":"Directed Teaching","info":"taken in conjunction with sppt 5999. language acquisition theory as applied to foreign language instruction at college level. how current theory translates into practice through hands-on practical application particular to communicative language instruction practiced in department of spanish/portuguese studies.","prereqInfo":"grad student with concurrent enrollment in 5999","prereq":{"code":"SPPT 5999","subject":"SPPT","id":"5999"}},{"code":"SPPT 5999","subject":"SPPT","id":"5999","title":"Teaching Spanish","info":"theoretical grounding in the general principles of second language acquisition and guidance with their practical applications to the teaching of first- and second-year spanish at the college-level.","prereqInfo":"grad or instr consent","prereq":[]},{"code":"SPPT 8400","subject":"SPPT","id":"8400","title":"Topics: Culture","info":"advanced research in methods of analysis of cultural products, including but not limited to literature.  emphasizes historical, ideological, and theoretical frameworks within which representative texts/events may be interpreted.","prereqInfo":"three 5xxx span or port courses","prereq":[]},{"code":"SPPT 8920","subject":"SPPT","id":"8920","title":"Intro Hisp/Luso Lit/Cult/Langs","info":"this two-credit seminar will familiarize beginning doctoral students in the areas of hispanic/lusophone literary and cultural studies and hispanic linguistics. course must be taken during spring semester of the first year. topics to be covered include: expected milestones and progress prior to reaching abd status;
