The course will look at the roles of local people, nonprofits, government agencies, and intergovernmental entities in determining how to best work with and serve vulnerable populations and how these different stakeholders collaborate while addressing complex, often sensitive situations. Course content will focus on citizenship and orphan/vulnerable children, as well as human trafficking, disabilities, migrant workers, and LGBT issues in the Thai context, as well as minority issues, especially with the hill tribes of Northern Thailand. Students in this course will utilize the content learned in this collaborative classroom setting and apply it individually toward a specific internship placement or research topic during the second half of the semester.",
    "prereqInfo": "This course encourages students to think critically about development theories and practices. For the majority of examples and reading, the course will draw on case studies from Thailand and links to global development issues. We will explore “development” as a contested value and process on multiple scales—local, national, and global. We will place special emphasis on the practice of development: What does it mean to actually “do” development in a cross-cultural international setting? We will examine the roles of outsiders and facilitators and how local communities and organizations can be empowered through the development process.",

    "info": "Food systems and sustainability are critical environmental and economic issues in understanding development. This course focuses on two connected issues: food production and agriculturally based entrepreneurship, including but not limited to coffee growing and production, sustainable and organic food production, and related topics. A key part of the course will be understanding the natural interconnectedness between the environment, where crops are cultivated, and the business of selling these crops on a local and/or international scale. The course will examine agricultural commodity production (coffee) from bean to cup, examining the growing, production, selling, and business of coffee as both a local production process, international commodity, and local consumption. We will further explore spaces for innovation in sustainable food production, in particular around community-supported sustainable and organic agriculture, and the role of small-scale production in ensuring the resilience and sustainability of the global food supply.",

Issues related to this topic will include public health, community education about health, veterinary, and animal care issues and organizations (and how human and animal health are linked), clinics, local hospitals, and traditional medicine. Special emphasis will be placed on contemporary issues in Thailand, especially success with public health and family planning, as well as issues around HIV/AIDS education and prevention, zoonotic disease such as COVID-19, and related issues.

The course does this by introducing various topics in the research cycle and providing a forum in which students can share with one another their research experience at each stage of the process. Through the course students will develop, defend, and challenge their own values and beliefs.",
    "prereqInfo": "Research projects in this course are ideally projects that fit with the development agency’s goals and activities; therefore, the student’s research interests must blend with what is realistically happening at the development agency. Students must have approved proposals before proceeding onto their research sites to allow them to collect necessary data and complete data analysis before heading back to Chiang Mai at the end of the six-week field period. It is likely that students will participate in field activities, meetings, and other forms of engagement that will be indirectly related to and could inform their research projects.",

    "prereqInfo": "The mentoring continues while students are at their internship placement as they come in contact with social actors, community organizations, and local and national authorities in various regions of Chiang Mai province at the marginal urban and rural levels. The students are urged to play an active role in their internships by providing suggestions and solutions, discussing alternatives, and investigating all areas of their internship placement to garner a holistic view of the realities of development work. Through practical internship experiences as well as readings, discussions, and written assignments, students will deepen their understanding of the host-country cultural context and development work from an international perspective, as well as critically examine their own worldview.",
