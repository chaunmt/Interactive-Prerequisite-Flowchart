    "info": "The overall mission of this course is to provide first-year Applied Plant Sciences (APS) students basic training in Research Ethics, educate them on best practices and strategies for succeeding in graduate school, and facilitate interactions within the incoming student cohort. The course is divided into two components: \n(1) Students will learn about and discuss various topics related to scientific research ethics, particularly themes that are pertinent to everyday plant science research. The ethics component of this class will be conducted in accordance with the UMN standards and guidelines (Appendix | Responsible Conduct of Research and Ethical Teaching and Scholarship (umn.edu)). \n(2) Students will learn about and discuss best practices for success in graduate school. A wide range of topics will be covered, including balancing research and scholastic responsibilities, and overall wellbeing. In class activities will focus on instructor presentations, small group discussions, and whole class discussions. Students will have weekly assignments that require activities and/or reflection on course topics, including weekly writing assignments.",

In terms of format, this course is combination of lecture, discussion, and computer lab, varying according to the topic. An emphasis will be placed on classical and current literature to teach concepts, as well as hands-on experience with data analysis.  \n\nIntroductory courses in plant breeding/genetics and statistics.

    "title": "Describing Genetic Diversity",
    "info": "Understanding how diversity is partitioned within populations is essential to breeding and allows us to make inferences about population history and taxonomy. As sequencing and genotyping technologies get cheaper and more universally available, these types of analyses are possible in more and more crops. While the tools to carry out such analyses are often relatively simple and user-friendly, correctly implementing and interpreting them is much more difficult. In this course, we will discuss several common ways of representing and describing genetic diversity, explore the theory underlying them, and develop an understanding of their strengths, weaknesses, and proper application. This is a graduate-level discussion and reading-heavy course appropriate for anyone interested in understanding how we quantify and describe genetic diversity. The class will include a brief overview of population genetics before focusing on commonly used analysis methods.",

The final product of this effort will be a drafted thesis proposal that each student will submit to their committee members and the program. Submission of a complete proposal to the student's committee and the APS program is required to complete this course.\n\nprereq: APS Graduate Student",
