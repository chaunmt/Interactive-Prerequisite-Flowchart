states? how do they fit into the u.s.'s history of immigration, race, and citizenship? is the \\\"model minority\\\" myth really true? this course is an introduction to asian american studies, an interdisciplinary field that uses ethnography, literature, histories, films, memoirs, and other texts to study how the history of asian immigration to the united states has visibly shaped existing asian american communities and identities, and how \\\"asian america\\\" is central to a more general understanding of american popular culture and public life.\n\nthe course is roughly organized chronologically. we will first begin with an introduction to the field of asian american studies by asking the questions: what is asian america? what is asian american studies\\\" we will then examine important concepts, categories, and processes before exploring the rich history of asian migration to the united states and contemporary issues facing asian americans today. \n\none of the core principles of this course is to encourage active and interdisciplinary learning. this means that we will be learning in a variety of ways to explore and understand the material (reading, writing, watching, listening, seeing, discussing, presenting). we will be drawing from a wide range of disciplines (history, law, sociology, education, cultural studies, psychology, etc.). and we will be using a variety of materials (memoir, scholarly articles, historical documents, government records, newspapers, films, photographs, popular culture, etc.) your active participation in these activities is essential.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"AAS 1201","subject":"AAS","id":"1201","title":"Racial Formation/Transform US","info":"how aggrieved racialized groups struggle over identity,

and racial nationalism around the globe in conjunction with recent assaults on traditional political institutions in the united states have raised concerns about the fate and future of democracy. political scientists largely agree that the united states has become more democratic over the past two centuries, but results from the authoritarian warning survey, a democratic-monitoring project, highlight the erosion of democratic principles and institutions in the past few years. concerns about the meaning, nature, promise, stability or instability of democracy are, however, not new. in order to better understand contemporary threats to democracy this course explores how the meanings and understandings of democracy changed over the last few centuries by examining the complicated relationship between democracy, populism and racial nationalism. is democracy a product of populism or imperiled by populism? what is the contemporary and historical relationship between democracy and racial nationalism? this seminar delves deeply into these questions by exploring a series of moments when the meanings and promise of democracy were contested. it begins with fundamental questions about the racial and gendered origins of american democracy. what is the relationship between the democratic state, the slave state and the settler colonial state? how did racial nationalism constitute and imperil american democracy from its origins? populists, that is members of mass movements that claim to speak for \\\"the people,\\\" have struggled to both extend and redefine the limits of democracy. in these efforts, \\\"citizens\\\" have frequently been pitted against non-citizens making questions of immigration, naturalization, and detention central to contestations over democracy and its perceived threats. moreover, in the united states, the relationship between detention and democracy can not be fully explored without paying significant attention to the rise of mass incarceration over the past half century. to what extent is the democratic state today threatened or maintained through the carceral state? \n\nstudent will engage with these issues through interdisciplinary lectures, course readings and discussions, and conversations with scholars, activists and organizations fostering democratic values and racial justice.\n\nthis course comes out of the democracy under threat interdisciplinary collaborative workshop. students will be invited to all democracy under threat events during the 2019-2020 academic year, including a spring 2020 conference, \\\"democracy under threat in times of populism and racial nationalism\\\" that will be held at the university of minnesota in partnership with howard university, morehouse college, and spelman college.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"AAS 3001","subject":"AAS","id":"3001","title":"Contmp Persp on Asian America","info":"interdisciplinary overview of asian american identities.

various racial and ethnic groups in order to help explain their present-day social status. this course is designed to help students begin to develop their own informed perspectives on american racial “problems” by introducing them to the ways that sociologists deal with race, ethnicity, race relations and racism.  we will expand our understanding of racial and ethnic dynamics by exploring the experiences of specific groups in the u.s. and how race/ethnicity intersects with sources of stratification such as class, nationality, and gender.  the course will conclude by re-considering ideas about assimilation, pluralism, and multiculturalism.  throughout, our goal will be to consider race both as a source of identity and social differentiation as well as a system of privilege, power and

focus on these inequalities as intertwined and deeply embedded in the history of the country. along with race, class, and gender we will focus on other axes of inequality including sexuality,

discussion, writing assignments, and oral presentations will focus on different ways of encountering and evaluating artistic work; for instance, students will write critical analyses and production

efforts to forward racial awareness, community activism, and social justice. our first unit will look at how particular stereotypes such as the yellow peril or the wartime enemy encouraged anti-asian feeling and violence and legal restrictions on immigration and naturalization. we will then examine how throughout history, asian immigrants and their descendants used song, dance, theater, writing,
