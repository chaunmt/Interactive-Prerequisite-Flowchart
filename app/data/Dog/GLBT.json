    "info": "What codes are at work that make a film Queer? In Queer Cinema, you will be an interpretive artist and active spectator as we analyze and consider subversive cinema from across nations and historical periods. Sometimes these films will be obviously queer or trans. However, the queer and trans film is often coded or distorted, especially in response to legal or societal censorship or disapproval. As a result, Queer directors and writers sometimes? speak? in a liberatory way to particular oppressed/silenced groups on the level of coded content, but if the content is consumed out of the context of the code, the experience of a film may be contradictory, even offensive. Consequently we'll be looking for the queer subversions within the distortions.",

We will look at very new works to understand the concerns of twenty-first century LGBTQIA writers and readers. From the \\\"lavender scare\\\" to the Stonewall Riots to the AIDS pandemic to marriage equality to genderqueer and trans movements, we will explore how LGBTQIA authors and filmmakers have both responded to and shaped the ethos of our times.",

    "info": "In America's cultural imagination, people with disabilities are figured either as childlike and asexual, or improperly hypersexual. For disabled people (or anyone perceived as disabled) this paradox has meant denial of sexual agency and gender expression, histories of forced sterilization and institutionalization, sociopolitical marginalization, and great risk of sexual violence (and even death). In this course, we'll examine this history to better understand our contemporary present. We'll analyze constructions of disability and sexuality as they are interwoven with gender, class, race, and citizenship. We will ask: What might it mean to desire disability? Is there a disability sexual culture? Do disabled people queer sex, or does sexuality queer disability? What is the relationship between GLBTQ and disability rights and liberation movements? Drawing from feminist, queer, and disability studies, we'll answer these questions (and more) by examining how the imagined able-bodymind structures our understanding of gender/sexuality, and how disability sexual cultures resist these norms.

Body modification can also represent cultural and subcultural identifications or expectations based on gender, race, class, and sexuality. But what we do with our bodies is never separate from the politics of cultural difference and fluctuating ideas of what is acceptable or unacceptable, civilized or uncivilized. These ideas are historically and culturally specific. This course looks at body modification on a transnational scale to ask how we come to know what differentiates \\\"mutilation\\\" from \\\"correction.\\\" We ask how feminist, queer and critical race theories illuminate these debates, reading across historical, anthropological, medical, and literary texts. Weekly topics include gender, race, and cosmetic surgery; skin whitening technologies; transnational gender reassignment; surgical tourism; female genital cutting; piercing, tattooing and scarification; the cultural politics of hair; and body modification in the context of transnational feminized labor.
