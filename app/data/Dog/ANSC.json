Topics include: genes and genomes, recombinant DNA technology, genetically modified foods and medicines, proteins as products, DNA fingerprinting and forensic analysis, bioremediation, aquatic biotechnology, medical biotechnology, and bioethics as it pertains to biotechnology. The course does not require any prerequisites and is targeted at students from all backgrounds and majors. We will discuss this history of biotechnology through current events. The laboratory component will focus on basic skills required in a molecular lab including aseptic technique, DNA extraction, pipetting, PCR, casting and running gels, data analysis, and guided bioinformatics lessons. The laboratory component will also teach molecular techniques necessary in forensic DNA fingerprinting, and how to gather DNA profiling data of individual animals to study population genetics. The course focuses primarily on the science biotechnology, but has strong components on ethics, policy, and society. For each topic, career paths are discussed, including how to prepare for careers in biotechnology fields.",

In addition, the course will introduce feed testing methods (Bacteriological Analytical Manual (BAM) methodology), common antibacterials/antibiotics used for decontamination and disinfection, and the emerging alternatives to antibiotics with a perspective on bacterial antibiotic resistance. In a flipped class room format, the students will gather necessary information provided by the instructor, listen to short lectures on the methods and mechanisms, participate in demonstrations, and apply it in a typical BSL2 laboratory set up under supervision.\n\nAll students should undergo BSL2 training prior to enrollment. Online training counts to approximately 5-6 hours.

As such, recognizing these conceptual areas in context, and using them for problem solving in their respective research areas is the ultimate goal of the course.\n\nUndergraduate level course in microbiology and physiology are suggested to enroll in this course.

In a flipped class room format, the students will gather necessary information provided by the instructor, listen to short lectures on the methods and mechanisms, participate in demonstrations, and apply it in a typical BSL2 laboratory set up under supervision. \n\n\nAll students should undergo BSL2 training prior to enrollment. Online training counts to approximately 5-6 hours.
