scientific literature produced up to date and hands on experiences to immerse attendants in the ever-growing microbiome field and open them to consider a microbiome lens to address different research questions in their respective fields. \n\nthe course emphasizes three main conceptual areas:\n\n1.\tcompositional and functional organization of microbial communities in the mammalian gut: from cells to functional communities.\n2.\tdietary drivers of the mammalian gut microbiome: nutritional ecology in the mammalian gut \n3.\thost-microbiome interactions: physiological impact of the mammalian gut microbiome  \n\nrather than memorizing these concepts, the course emphasizes the need to apply them to real life issues in animal and human nutrition and health. as such, recognizing these conceptual areas in context, and using them for problem solving in their respective research areas is the ultimate goal of the course.\n\nundergraduate level course in microbiology and physiology are suggested to enroll in this course. also, previous completion of statistics courses and familiarity with the r statistical interface and command line are
