Students will begin to develop critical reading and writing skills that are central to a successful undergraduate education. The course bridges the fields of business communication, organizational communication, rhetorical studies, and critical media studies.\n\nAt the end of the course, students will emerge with better understanding of communicative practices during crises. Students will be encouraged to identify ethical and unethical communication practices. Students will also learn to discuss and recognize the larger societal and political implications of a variety of case studies.",

To examine these questions we must gain familiarity with standard analytical techniques and the assumptions, often unexamined, that both scholars and ordinary people use to amass sacred texts as evidence for their views. While centering on the role of the Bible in the major branches of Christianity, we will also discuss issues in Islam, the Sikhs, and the polytheistic religion of ancient Greece.",

This seminar attempts to make visible what stories our culture tells itself about food. Therefore, as critical media theorists have argued, food media (and the rituals surrounding it) raise important questions in relation to power, identity, and ethics. Accordingly, food media are situated at the intersecting categories of race, class, gender, nationality, sexuality, and the environment. This course provides an introduction to the food and media nexus by drawing particular attention to the ways in which the political economy of the media, content analysis, ethnography, and audiences can lend unique insight into what we eat. Students will critically analyze food media across a wide-range of platforms and embark on field trips to restaurants and food-related sites in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. ",

Defined as \\\"a photograph that one has taken of oneself, typically one taken with a smartphone or webcam and uploaded to a social media website,\\\" the selfie is now a staple of social media platforms from Facebook to Instagram, and taking and posting selfies has become a regular social practice, particularly for young people. How did this happen? This seminar examines the emerging media \\\"culture of me\\\" from a range of critical perspectives. Tracing the cultural history of the selfie from earlier forms of self-portraiture and first-person media to the rise of social media, we will examine the selfie phenomenon within broader cultural trends, from the explosion of ordinary people in the media to developments in interactive media technologies, micro celebrity, integrated marketing, and self-branding.",

In this seminar, we will examine the history of social movements designed to provide women and men with reproductive autonomy, paying close attention to how those movements often failed to center the needs of those most marginalized.  This seminar will address the various elements that impact family creation including medical racism, economic (in)security, comprehensive sexual education, and environmental protections.  Students will learn how to critique and invent better reproductive rhetoric that more accurately accounts for the contextual complexities surrounding our reproductive moment.  ",

Together, we will work towards understanding the interplay between sound and social justice, examining the different sonic dimensions of cultural, political, and social rights around the world. We will consider issues of race, immigration, gender and sexuality, labor, and war with an eye (and an ear) towards what protest, progress, and change quite literally sound like. This course will make use of a wide range of media and learning styles, such as listening exercises, class discussions, field trips, and multimodal research projects. Ultimately, students will explore how our sonic realities inform our understanding and response to both cultural and human rights.",

    "info": "Sports are something that illustrate both the best and worst aspects of society. On one hand, sports can provide common ground for those who may share few other similarities.  On the other hand, sports serve to construct and reinforce the very social and cultural differences they so effectively transcend.  Perhaps more than any other popular cultural arena, sports shape, illustrate, and bolster expectations for how people ought to conduct themselves depending on their racial, class, gender, and sexual identities.  Consequently, sporting events, the identity performances these events reinforce, and the way media outlets represent these events and performances can expose some of the most difficult and urgent questions within contemporary cultural theory, popular culture studies, and media studies.\n\nFocusing specifically on an American context, this course will combine theoretical and sports-oriented readings from communication scholars to discuss the roles sports play in American culture, their power to influence identity performances, and how sports are represented and consumed—from live events viewed in a stadium to fantasy sports.  We will examine how sports, as texts, help us to grapple with the intersections among identity, politics, media, and culture. \n",

It is about music as a living and breathing art form, imbricated into ecological contexts, rather than abstracted out and isolated on stage, page, or museum exhibit (although those contexts also matter).

Some concerns have become intense enough to rise to the level of a moral panic, a concept we'll use to understand the social and historical forces at work in framing public responses to media content such as that found in radio, film, telephones, comic books, TV, the internet, and social media. Historical moral panics around jazz music, comic books, and TV violence have inspired legislation and even censorship to control children's access to particular kinds of media content. In this course, we will examine some of these moral panics--such as the one set in motion against comic books by psychiatrist Frederic Wertham's 1954 book Seduction of the Innocent--situate them in their historical and social contexts, and investigate both the forces behind such panics and the public responses they have inspired.",

Course topics will relate visual images to particular historical moments, including the early exclusion period and the \\\"yellow peril\\\" stereotype; WWII Japanese American incarceration and the drawings of Miné Okubo, and photo-journalism documenting U.S. military involvement in Southeast Asia and its aftermath. How do photographic and other images work to counter historical amnesia, heal traumatic loss, and document social injustice? Other weeks of the class will explore the ways that individuals, families, and communities use photographs, video, and other visual media to preserve a sense of connection and belonging. We will also look at how contemporary Asian American photographers such as Tseng Kwong Chi, Nikki Lee, and Wing Young Huie experiment with visual images to raise questions of racial and national identity, social inequality, gender, sexuality, and political agency.

Our first unit will look at how particular stereotypes such as the yellow peril or the wartime enemy encouraged anti-Asian feeling and violence and legal restrictions on immigration and naturalization. We will then examine how throughout history, Asian immigrants and their descendants used song, dance, theater, writing, and other forms of popular culture to express personal desires and foster collective ties. Our final unit concentrates on contemporary popular culture and its relationship to the changing identities of Asian Americans. How do Asian Americans influence the current essays, films, and videos that are consumed by millions today? How are increasingly pan-ethnic, interracial, multiracial, transnational, and global experiences reflected in popular culture?",

This course is divided into three units: the history, theory, and wicked problems of secrecy and surveillance as they manifest in public and political culture. The core argument of this class is that we live in public, and that our information and our bodies are frequently exposed to the world and to a degree that we may not realize. One recurring theme of this course that is intended to prepare students for civic life beyond the university is that what we consider to be secret is often no secret at all, and the fact that we must live in public creates moral dilemmas which often go unrecognized in our everyday lives.",
