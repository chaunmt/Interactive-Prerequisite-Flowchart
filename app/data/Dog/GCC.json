(2) what human (anthropogenic) activities disrupt ocean bgcc of nutrients, resulting in depletion of biodiversity, ecosystem health, ecosystem services, and environmental justice for humans? (3) what do humans have to do to protect the future of ocean health and all of humanity?\n\nglobal recycling of nutrients and metals within the environment (geosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere) and the biosphere are essential for maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services on which all of humanity depends. living organisms extract and transform nutrients for their metabolism, growth, and reproduction, ultimately releasing these nutrients (often in a transformed state) back to the inanimate sphere via biogeochemical cycling (bgcc) driven by energy transformations. in natural environments, bgcc maintains a dynamic equilibrium/homeostasis between abiotic and biotic spheres, a process essential for survival of life on earth. however, the current human practices have caused massive changes in the bgcc of nutrients, thus disrupting the natural cycling and (i) threatening the biosphere’s nutrient availability and (ii) precipitating many of the current environmental problems such as climate change, nitrogen pollution, ocean acidification, acid rain, mercury deposition, etc. at the current scale of human development, these alterations to the bgcc in the oceans may seriously damage the environment and biodiversity, thus threatening the entire planet’s future. further, the adverse effects of the loss of ecosystem services may not be shared equally amongst society, whereby access to a healthy environment is increasingly distributed by power, class, and race. an understanding of these inequities and incorporation of environmental justice in eco-centric environmental advocacy will be essential for sustaining the health of our planet. therefore, the students registering for this course will develop an understanding and the scope of the anthropogenic alterations in natural biogeochemical cycling of oceans that will help them develop strategies to intervene, advocate, and sustain planetary health for all of humanity. the specific aims are following: (1) describe global and local mechanisms of natural bgcc on earth and connection to the oceans; (2) explain human impacts on bgcc, and relationships between abnormal bgcc and nutrient distribution in water, sediment, and air; (3) determine impact of human-altered ocean nutrient cycling on society, including members disproportionately impacted by environmental issues and underrepresented in environmental movements; (4) strategize sustainable strategies to mitigate the health and environmental problems associated with abnormal biogeochemical nutrient cycling, bringing environmental justice perspectives to the forefront; and (5) convince students that positive actions made now can and will impact the future.\n\nthis course will focus on multiple vectors of inquiry (i.e., chemistry, toxicology, environment science and justice, sustainability and biodiversity), and students' progress through the course will give them powerful tools to confront the grand challenges of our age, global change in biogeochemical cycles.\n\nthis is a grand challenge curriculum course.",

    "info": "the science is clear that we need to decarbonize the economy on a global scale as soon as possible to prevent catastrophic effects of climate change on human health and the environment. what does it mean to develop a prosperous carbon-neutral economy, while also improving people’s lives and the environment? how can this transition happen to make the benefits of societal wealth more equitable, and while protecting vulnerable populations? will a transition to a carbon-free economy force us to change our quality of life? together we will seek practical solutions to address these complex challenges. while there isn’t a single “right” solution to grand challenges, progress can be made through an interdisciplinary perspective. this course will attempt to answer these questions through: a series of primers—lectures and discussions on key topics—to build your understanding of key topics for creating a carbon neutral economy explore the conflicts that exist between solutions to rapidly reduce carbon emissions and create a clean energy future, through a deep case study of minnesota “knowledge to impact” workshops that introduce key skills and capacities for addressing any complex challenge working in interdisciplinary teams to build upon lectures, discussions, and workshops to propose a well-developed solution to a problem related to the course’s grand challenge.",

    "title": "Child Labor Global Perspective",
    "info": "it seems obvious that we should oppose child labor. or should we? this course challenges students to think critically about the many angles that need to be considered in deciding whether any particular type of children's work should be opposed or permitted. drawing on contemporary and historical scholarship in the interdisciplinary arena of childhood and youth studies, this course takes on ethical as well as economic analyses; it reflects upon child development and legal perspectives; it examines cases ranging across the globe and across recent centuries. it may very well change the way you think about kids, forever. historians find evidence of many different kinds of \\\"childhoods,\\\" as well as changing notions of what work is appropriate for children. coming from social-scientific and policy studies approaches, analysts and critics of contemporary global policies affecting child labor argue that the presumed superiority of \\\"modern western childhood\\\" needs rethinking. this course will also look at tensions between the presumption that schooling should be the only or primary occupation of childhood years and competing ideas child labor can be valuable and justifiable in many settings including, for example, american farm families. looking at child labor from comparative global and historical perspectives will encourage and enable students to address some important questions: what types of ?work? have children done in various modern historical and contemporary settings? when and how is work arguably bad, or good, for children and their families? under what conditions is schooling better than work, or vice-versa? who gets to decide what's best for children? how should governments intervene, and how does intervention differ when children work for their family as opposed to other employers? what forms of regulatory measures or political activism have changed policies and practices regarding child labor in the past and present?\n\nthis is a grand challenge curriculum course.",

    "info": "our world is facing multiple crises that demand increasingly innovative solutions. this is happening just when the creative capacity of our society as a whole has steadily decreased (the creativity crisis by kyung hee kim). the challenge is to develop more creative capital. the drive to be curious supports our ability to generate ideas that are new and valuable while the drive to conform allows us to spread those ideas. students will study not only creativity, but characteristics of conformity that maximize the spread ideas. creative ‘muscle’ is strengthened when people are curious, ask questions, speculate more, and test theories rather than passively observe. creative capital increases when groups of people have an easy and attractive way to do that. the goal of this course is not only to teach individuals creative techniques, but to teach how to spread creative thinking by making creativity as contagious as a weaponized virus, as addictive as an opioid drug, as habitual as your afternoon snack.",

    "info": "despite understanding the consequences of not acting to curb unsustainability, why do people fail to act? human’s behavioral apathy toward sustainability may be due to an inaccurate characterization of sustainability and/or a lack of understanding of cultural diversity and behavior. therefore, an understanding of the human behavior will contribute greatly to (i) decipher human actions that negatively impact global ecosystems, (ii) slowdown or stop human ecologically destructive trajectory, and (iii) promote sustainable alternatives. the problem is that environmental issues are not generally included in psychology programs, and psychology is not often represented in environmental programs. in the united nation’s (un) sustainable development goals 2030 (un sdg 2030), psychological indices have been conspicuously absent (except for mental health in general terms) even though environmental degradation, social or economic inequity, all are implicated by human behavior. the un sdg 2030 is based on the unproven concept that sustainability is an intersection of social, economic and environmental factors, the key pillars of sustainability. since economic activity and society are subsets of human behavior, psychology should be considered central to unsustainability and/or sustainability. therefore, we hypothesize that behavioral psychology has a critical role to play in creating a sustainable society. the aim of the proposed gcc is to discuss (un)sustainability using this new paradigm that will allow new approaches to achieve transition from unsustainability to sustainability worldwide. the specific aims of the proposed gcc are following: (i) describe interaction between sustainability and behavioral psychology as the 4th pillar of sustainability. (ii) explain the behavioral correlates of cultural differences in terms of transition to sustainability. (iii) explain the consumption (related to unsustainability) and conservation (related to sustainability) behavior. (iv) determine the place of psychology in the un’s sustainable development goals (sdgs) that are mostly based on sociology, economy and environment. (v) describe humanity’s transition from unsustainable to sustainable development. \n\nthis is a grand challenge curriculum course. gcc courses are open to all students and fulfill an honors experience for university honors program students.",
