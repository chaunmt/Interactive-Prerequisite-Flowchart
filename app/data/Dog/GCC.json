In this freshman seminar we take an interdisciplinary approach to talk about and seek to understand the implications of accelerating dislocations and disparities in education, work, social relationships, and life styles -- for young adults and those at other life stages. How can both individuals and organizations respond to this new and dynamic reality? Is technology the driver of stress and inequality, or can we harness it in ways that promote health, engagement, and happiness, as well as greater equality?  Are hyper-changes opening up risks but also possibilities for rewriting life scripts? How can we rock the boat, creating new ways of learning, working, caring, and living that make sense in these tumultuous times? These are the questions we will be addressing in this class. ",

Students will begin this course by understanding how mainstream news organizations operate, how journalists make coverage decisions and how the landscape of news has dramatically changed in this century as a result of social media, the algorithms behind those platforms or the technologies that can convincingly portray fake stories or images as true. Throughout the rest of the semester, the class will follow how various media cover selected issues in the news – major issues such as climate change, immigration or the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Using daily reading of news, journaling, in-class discussions, weekly readings, group assignments and two papers, students will identify the sometimes-conflicting narratives that emerge from the coverage they observe, reflecting on their own ethical responsibility as consumers and disseminators of news and information in a digital world and the importance of transparency, inquiry and truth-seeking in our society.",

There are 7000 diseases, but in aggregate, these diseases affect 30 million (i.e. 1 in 10) Americans of all ages and additional millions of people globally. Most of these conditions are serious and life-altering and children account for more than 50% of those affected. However, only 5% of all rare diseases have FDA-approved treatments. Thus, there is a large unmet need in this area and one way to address this is to raise awareness about these conditions. \n\nIn this highly interactive course comprising of weekly seminars and related readings on topics related to the understanding of rare diseases and the economics, regulatory and public policy aspects of development of drugs (orphan products) to treat these conditions in the US and across the globe. Students will learn from and network with researchers, healthcare professionals and business leaders and gain sufficient background to appreciate the scope of this multidisciplinary field. Students will work in teams with a patient advocacy organization to learn firsthand the challenges related to the diagnosis and treatment of a specific rare disease, barriers to research and development and deliver possible solutions to a specific challenge that they have identified.\n",

For many grand challenges like this, we observe a common theme: human health depends upon the environment, and the environment depends on the health and sustainability of human communities.\n\nThese large-scale grand challenges can often become overwhelming, and a solution that considers only one aspect of health often seems daunting and difficult to implement in policy. How can we usefully understand the interactions between these challenges to contribute to solutions? How can one’s own discipline and career path relate to these complex grand challenges? How do we build teams and partnerships across disciplines to engage at the scale of the problem?\n\nThis course introduces Ecosystem Health (ESH) as a framework and practice for developing complex solutions for grand challenges. In particular, the course will:\n•\tfocus on the emerging discipline of Ecosystem Health, and associated approaches and technologies that support solutions to grand challenges of health at the interface of humans, animals, and the environment.\n•\tintroduce a toolset for approaching, defining, and responding to these grand challenges, including systems thinking, complexity science, and integrative leadership.\n•\tinterrogate the conflicts that exist between differing conceptions of health, through the study of several complex cases.\n",

This course, part of a Carlson Ventures Enterprise effort to develop a “Sharing Economy of Experienced Human Capital,” will identify the knowledge and skills needed by community organizations and linking them with both current students and experienced older people able to help.\n\nThe course will include traditional students and retirees and apply their technical knowledge and life experience to the needs of Twin-Cities communities. The course will address the Grand Challenge theme of “Enhancing Individual and Community Capacity for a Changing World.” \n\nThis is a time limited opportunity. If the university is to contribute to addressing this challenge, the time is now. If we take years to respond, we will miss the window.   ",

    "info": "As an evolved animal, humanity has always interacted with its environment, both through the ecology of its food web and through its modification of its geological surroundings. Yet the human ecological niche, and the breadth of its impact on the environment, has changed enormously through the biological and cultural evolution of our lineage, from our first two-legged ancestor; to the appearance of our own species, Homo sapiens; to the diversification of the hunter-gatherer adaptation at the end of the Pleistocene; to the invention of agriculture and animal husbandry in the Holocene; to the rise of craft specialization, social inequalities, and urbanism with the first state-level societies; and now the globalization of our food, diseases, and culture. Students in this course will explore how the cumulative effects of our biocultural evolution are putting the sustainability of our current population, now approaching 11 billion, at risk, mostly due to the unprecedented scale of humanity's impact on the Earth's ecosystems. This course investigates the origins, development, and predictions for humanity's ecological niche on the planet through a novel interdisciplinary fusion of the social and environmental sciences to give students i) the ability to see the environmental context of the present in an evolutionary light, as well as ii) the tools to evaluate possible remediation and sustainability approaches to control these problems at the local and global scale. The course provides an interdisciplinary immersion in these issues through combined instruction by anthropologists, archaeologists, historians, environmental scientists, ecologists, toxicologists, and sociologists. By focusing on multiple vectors of inquiry (i.e., society, economy, technology, environment) which can be considered at different scales (i.e., from past to present, local to global, individual to societal, temporary to long term), students' progress through the course will give them powerful tools to confront the Grand Challenges of our age, the Anthropocene.

Will sustainability require that we sacrifice the gains humanity has made in our quality of life? Or can we find a way to create a good Anthropocene? This course will attempt to answer these questions in four ways:\n1. By providing an overview of sustainability science, both what it says about about human and natural systems and how it comes to make these claims\n2. By examining various conceptions of the good life, both individual and social, and how they intersect with the findings of sustainability science \n3. By exploring the conflicts that exist within and between differing visions of sustainability and the good life through case studies in energy, water, and food\n4.

But the general citizenry does not understand our current energy systems, particularly the seemingly invisible phenomena of electricity, and its generation, distribution, and use. Technical knowledge is only half the solution, however. It is through human decisions and behaviors that technical solutions get applied and adopted, and the importance of communication and storytelling is being recognized for its relevance to making change. How can science literacy and behavior-motivating engagement and storytelling be combined to help make systemic change? This course explores the integration of science-based environmental education, with art-led, place-based exploration of landscapes and creative map-making to address this challenge. How do we make electricity visible, understandable, and interesting -- so we can engage citizens in energy conservation with basic literacy about the electric power system so that they can be informed voters, policy advocates, and consumers. In this class, you will take on this challenge, first learning about the electric power systems you use, their cultural and technical history, systems thinking, design thinking, and prior examples of communication and education efforts. With this foundation, you will then apply your learning to create a public education project delivered via online GIS Story maps that use a combination of data, art, and story to help others understand, and act on the power journey we are all on. All will share the  common exploration of power systems through field trips, and contribute to a multi-faceted story of power, presented in a group map and individual GIS Story maps. No prior knowledge of GIS story maps or electricity issues is needed. The study of power systems can be a model for learning and communicating about other topics that explore the interaction of technology and society toward sustainability. \n\nThis is a Grand Challenge Curriculum course.

Bold and innovative solutions are needed to address this grand challenge. Integration is one such method that can potentially increase the success and sustainability of approaches to reduce health disparities and create a culture of health for all. Integration is an approach to solving complex public health problems that merges academic research, clinical practice, policy and community resources in new ways.\n\nThis interactive course will challenge students to identify root causes of health, including access to food, housing, transportation and education. Students will also focus on health disparities and barriers to eliminating these existing, disparate, negative outcomes. Students will be introduced to the concept of integration science and practice; will learn about the importance of integration across research, practice, community, and policy domains to address health disparities; and will cultivate the communication skills needed to intentionally and successfully facilitate integration practice. Course instructors with unique vantage points as concerned scientists, health practitioners, and policy wonks will engage students in class discussions and activities, individual writing assignments and small-group work aimed at unveiling the reasons health disparities persist globally--challenging them to consider opportunities for integration to alleviate existing disparities.

And how can we foster more of it in ourselves, our friends, our children, and our fellow citizens? \n\nThis course is taught by a philosopher and a psychologist, and we approach questions like these from both perspectives. Traditionally, many philosophers have thought that we need to cultivate virtues such as compassion and open-mindedness in order to be good people. Some recent psychological work casts doubt on this picture: the social and environmental forces that influence our behavior cannot be overcome with virtuous character! On the other hand, psychological research also shows that some of the good traits we have are ones that develop reliably, from early childhood. Which perspective offers more opportunities for progress? Should we foster good agency by working on individual character or by changing social circumstances? Or, if both are important, what would a combined approach look like? \n\nThe ultimate goal of the course is to encourage students to apply the theoretical and scientific ideas about improving agency to specific grand challenges. How do philosophy and psychology help us to define and resolve the challenges that confront people who want to make a difference? To provide a model for this kind of research, we focus on structural racism and white supremacy to expose the ways in which individual and structural forces can impede epistemic and moral agency.

Unfortunately, these large-scale problems often become overwhelming, making single solution-based progress seem daunting and difficult to implement in policy. Fortunately, the emerging discipline of ecosystem health provides an approach to these problems grounded in trans-disciplinary science. Ecosystem health recognizes the interdependence of human, animal and environmental health, and merges theories and methods of ecological, health and political sciences. It poses that health threats can be prevented, monitored and controlled via a variety of approaches and technologies that guide management action as well as policy. Thus, balancing human and animal health with the management of our ecosystems. In this class, we will focus on the emerging discipline of ecosystem health, and how these theories, methods, and shared leadership approaches set the stage for solutions to grand challenges of health at the interface of humans, animals, and the environment.

We will seek to understand accompaniment, or the practice of walking alongside and supporting communities, as well as the efforts of those who challenge power and work for social justice to change the structural determination of health.   Demonstrating that health equity demands much more than healthcare, an interdisciplinary teaching team will draw on the disciplines of anthropology, sociology, economics, history, public policy, biomedicine, public health, and the arts to provide students with a foundation to understand the complex, interrelated forces that shape health in communities. The course will incorporate numerous “classroom-less” experiences to facilitate conversation and relationship-building between students and community members and organizations working to promote health.  The course will prioritize experiential pedagogy including community engagement; neighborhood walks and tours; group and individual reflection; theater, film, and other art forms; and prioritization of narrative to understand patient, community, and health professional experiences. Recognizing that advancing health equity requires community-building and social cohesion, the course will also utilize pedagogy that promotes critical self-reflection and builds classroom community.  The course will integrate considerable reflection upon personal experiences with power, privilege, race, class, and gender; incorporates assignments that are action-oriented and focused on learning skills to lead change; and seeks to expand social cohesion in the communities of participants.

This course will also look at tensions between the presumption that schooling should be the only or primary occupation of childhood years and competing ideas child labor can be valuable and justifiable in many settings including, for example, American farm families. Looking at child labor from comparative global and historical perspectives will encourage and enable students to address some important questions: What types of “work” have children done in various modern historical and contemporary settings? When and how is work arguably bad, or good, for children and their families? Under what conditions is schooling better than work, or vice-versa? Who gets to decide “what’s best for children”?

Our focus is on wealth--the total amount of accumulated assets, broadly\ndefined, in individuals, households, communities, and beyond--because it is precisely these starkly\nuneven stores of value, reproduced through inheritances across generations, that have accelerated\ncontemporary inequality.\nWe will work to understand the social structures, historical conjunctures, and global processes that\nperpetuate the inequitable distribution of wealth in our current moment. We will then envision social\nchanges that promise to reduce wealth disparities and create a more just and equitable world.\nThroughout, we will explore how culture, identity, institutions, economic and political systems, and\nother social forces are entangled with and constitute the global flows of money and assets.\nThe purview of this course is global, as our attention will focus on the large global and structural\nprocesses and historical conjunctures that have long shaped global wealth inequality. It makes little\nsense to limit the inquiry to national borders given the unequal distribution of wealth was produced on\na global scale.\nAt the same time, we are mindful of the importance to act (and think) locally; as such, many of our\nexamples and readings will focus on the United States. Given that wealth inequality in the U.S. is one of\nthe worst in the world--the richest 1 percent have captured nearly 60 percent of all income gains from\n1977 to 2000, and in 2010, the top 20 percent of households owned almost 90 percent of all privately\nheld wealth in the US, while the net worth of the bottom 40 percent was negative-- it will serve as an\nimportant case study.\nInstead of addressing the key causes of inequality, the powerful across the world have seized on these\nconditions to mobilize an avalanche of discontent among sectors of the downwardly mobile in a way\nthat often obscures the key reasons for their predicament and scapegoats those at the social margins.\nGiven this context, it is imperative to better understand and analyze the histories, cultural assumptions,\nand hierarchies that have produced contemporary inequalities, locally, regionally, and globally.\nDeveloping this shared understanding--as we will do in this course--is critical for our potential to address\nthis and the other interrelated grand challenges facing us. \n\nThis is a Grand Challenge Curriculum course.",

The following grand challenge questions will be addressed: (1) How does Ocean Biogeochemical Cycling (BGCC) of nutrients support global ecosystems and biodiversity? (2) What human (anthropogenic) activities disrupt ocean BGCC of nutrients, resulting in depletion of biodiversity, ecosystem health, ecosystem services, and environmental justice for humans? (3) What do humans have to do to protect the future of ocean health and all of humanity?\n\nGlobal recycling of nutrients and metals within the environment (geosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere) and the biosphere are essential for maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services on which all of humanity depends. Living organisms extract and transform nutrients for their metabolism, growth, and reproduction, ultimately releasing these nutrients (often in a transformed state) back to the inanimate sphere via biogeochemical cycling (BGCC) driven by energy transformations. In natural environments, BGCC maintains a dynamic equilibrium/homeostasis between abiotic and biotic spheres, a process essential for survival of life on Earth. However, the current human practices have caused massive changes in the BGCC of nutrients, thus disrupting the natural cycling and (i) threatening the biosphere’s nutrient availability and (ii) precipitating many of the current environmental problems such as climate change, nitrogen pollution, ocean acidification, acid rain, mercury deposition, etc. At the current scale of human development, these alterations to the BGCC in the oceans may seriously damage the environment and biodiversity, thus threatening the entire Planet’s future. Further, the adverse effects of the loss of ecosystem services may not be shared equally amongst society, whereby access to a healthy environment is increasingly distributed by power, class, and race. An understanding of these inequities and incorporation of environmental justice in eco-centric environmental advocacy will be essential for sustaining the health of our planet. Therefore, the students registering for this course will develop an understanding and the scope of the anthropogenic alterations in natural biogeochemical cycling of oceans that will help them develop strategies to intervene, advocate, and sustain planetary health for all of humanity. The specific aims are following: (1) Describe global and local mechanisms of natural BGCC on Earth and connection to the oceans; (2) Explain human impacts on BGCC, and relationships between abnormal BGCC and nutrient distribution in water, sediment, and air; (3) Determine impact of human-altered ocean nutrient cycling on society, including members disproportionately impacted by environmental issues and underrepresented in environmental movements; (4) Strategize sustainable strategies to mitigate the health and environmental problems associated with abnormal biogeochemical nutrient cycling, bringing environmental justice perspectives to the forefront; and (5) Convince students that positive actions made now can and will impact the future.\n\nThis course will focus on multiple vectors of inquiry (i.e., chemistry, toxicology, environment science and justice, sustainability and biodiversity), and students' progress through the course will give them powerful tools to confront the Grand Challenges of our age, global change in biogeochemical cycles.\n\nThis is a Grand Challenge Curriculum course.",

Human’s behavioral apathy toward sustainability may be due to an inaccurate characterization of sustainability and/or a lack of understanding of cultural diversity and behavior. Therefore, an understanding of the human behavior will contribute greatly to (i) decipher human actions that negatively impact global ecosystems, (ii) slowdown or stop human ecologically destructive trajectory, and (iii) promote sustainable alternatives. The problem is that environmental issues are not generally included in psychology programs, and psychology is not often represented in environmental programs. In the United Nation’s (UN) Sustainable Development goals 2030 (UN SDG 2030), psychological indices have been conspicuously absent (except for mental health in general terms) even though environmental degradation, social or economic inequity, all are implicated by human behavior. The UN SDG 2030 is based on the unproven concept that sustainability is an intersection of social, economic and environmental factors, the key pillars of sustainability. Since economic activity and society are subsets of human behavior, psychology should be considered central to unsustainability and/or sustainability. Therefore, we hypothesize that behavioral psychology has a critical role to play in creating a sustainable society. The aim of the proposed GCC is to discuss (un)sustainability using this new paradigm that will allow new approaches to achieve transition from unsustainability to sustainability worldwide. The specific aims of the proposed GCC are following: (i) Describe interaction between sustainability and behavioral psychology as the 4th pillar of sustainability. (ii) Explain the behavioral correlates of cultural differences in terms of transition to sustainability. (iii) Explain the consumption (related to unsustainability) and conservation (related to sustainability) behavior.

Such collaborative initiatives take place in broader social contexts; have key individual and organizational inputs; and can take many forms, from community task forces to organized collective impact initiatives to social enterprise organizations that blend private-sector incentives with public-service goals. Because they involve a conscious focus on we versus me, and operate largely apart from well-established processes or mission statements, they force us to examine civic life through a new lens and to (re)consider ethical questions related to it. \n\nThis course explores multisector leadership from a variety of perspectives and provides an opportunity for students to work together to apply what they are learning individually and in teams through in-class exercises, peer coaching, and a final team grant proposal project. After an introductory session where students analyze and present answers related to specific case studies, we begin with an overview of relevant shared leadership theories and practice fields --- including collective, participatory and integrative leadership and an overview of relevant ethical questions and themes. We then consider relevant individual inputs into multisector leadership, including through having students assess their own leadership strengths, what they bring to the collaborative table, and contract with assigned interdisciplinary teams for peer coaching throughout the semester. The lens of the course moves to the collaboration itself after this focus on the individual, looking at techniques and qualities of successful teams, including those composed of diverse individuals or organizations. Finally, we move to considering different contexts, forms and specific examples of multisector leadership before concluding with presentations to an external panel of each student team?s grant proposal for a particular multisectoral initiative of their choosing that they believe will enable transformative action to tackle a significant societal issue and achieve lasting change.  \n\nThroughout the course, we consider the ethical questions that arise from focusing on multisector leadership. These questions relate, for example, to the role of trust and truth-telling in individual efforts to lead and collaborate; how and when it is appropriate to engage with others to address challenges that extend beyond the communities to which we belong; who defines priority problems to be addressed, and why; the role and potential of business to contribute to broader efforts to achieve public good; how equity and justice relate to collective leadership; and whether and how society is better off from the joining of organizational efforts across sectors. \n",

Students in this course will explore how the cumulative effects of our biocultural evolution are putting the sustainability of our current population, now approaching 11 billion, at risk, mostly due to the unprecedented scale of humanity's impact on the Earth's ecosystems. This course investigates the origins, development, and predictions for humanity's ecological niche on the planet through a novel interdisciplinary fusion of the social and environmental sciences to give students i) the ability to see the environmental context of the present in an evolutionary light, as well as ii) the tools to evaluate possible remediation and sustainability approaches to control these problems at the local and global scale. The course provides an interdisciplinary immersion in these issues through combined instruction by anthropologists, archaeologists, historians, environmental scientists, ecologists, toxicologists, and sociologists.

And how can we foster more of it in ourselves, our friends, our children, and our fellow citizens? \n\nThis course is taught by a philosopher and a psychologist, and we approach questions like these from both perspectives. Traditionally, many philosophers have thought that we need to cultivate virtues such as compassion and open-mindedness in order to be good people. Some recent psychological work casts doubt on this picture: the social and environmental forces that influence our behavior cannot be overcome with virtuous character! On the other hand, psychological research also shows that some of the good traits we have are ones that develop reliably, from early childhood. Which perspective offers more opportunities for progress? Should we foster good agency by working on individual character or by changing social circumstances? Or, if both are important, what would a combined approach look like? \n\nThe ultimate goal of the course is to encourage students to apply the theoretical and scientific ideas about improving agency to specific grand challenges. How do philosophy and psychology help us to define and resolve the challenges that confront people who want to make a difference? To provide a model for this kind of research, we focus on structural racism and white supremacy to expose the ways in which individual and structural forces can impede epistemic and moral agency.

Looking at child labor from comparative global and historical perspectives will encourage and enable students to address some important questions: What types of ?work? have children done in various modern historical and contemporary settings? When and how is work arguably bad, or good, for children and their families? Under what conditions is schooling better than work, or vice-versa? Who gets to decide what's best for children? How should governments intervene, and how does intervention differ when children work for their family as opposed to other employers? What forms of regulatory measures or political activism have changed policies and practices regarding child labor in the past and present?\n\nThis is a Grand Challenge Curriculum course.",

    "info": "Seeking Connection through Decolonization: The Power of Indigenous Languages and Place-Based Knowledge in the Face of Racism\n\nHow has unequal distribution of power resulted in the decline in Indigenous language and the loss of societal connections to the land? How might we all, from different positionalities, revitalize our relationships to indigenous land and languages, in the face of racism and attempts to perpetuate colonization? In this course students will grapple with ideological roots of the ongoing decline in Indigenous language and place-based knowledge and how their decline has implications for all peoples. To understand the connections, students will participate in Indigenous language learning (Dakota and Ojibwe) as acts of cultural production. Discussion and reading will be supplemented with visits to local sites, for example,  Medicine Gardens, Bell Museum, Gibbs Farm, and Bdote to directly interact with the land as pedagogy. Through the course themes, students will experience the interconnectedness of place-based knowledge, language, and human identity, while also seeing the importance of understanding the lands on which one resides and the power of indigenous languages in re-imagining those relationships. \n\nThis is a Grand Challenge Curriculum (GCC) course.

    "info": "Our world is facing multiple crises that demand increasingly innovative solutions. This is happening just when the creative capacity of our society as a whole has steadily decreased (The Creativity Crisis by Kyung Hee Kim). The challenge is to develop more creative capital. The drive to be curious supports our ability to generate ideas that are new and valuable while the drive to conform allows us to spread those ideas. Students will study not only creativity, but characteristics of conformity that maximize the spread ideas. Creative ‘muscle’ is strengthened when people are curious, ask questions, speculate more, and test theories rather than passively observe. Creative capital increases when groups of people have an easy and attractive way to do that. The goal of this course is not only to teach individuals creative techniques, but to teach how to spread creative thinking by making creativity as contagious as a weaponized virus, as addictive as an opioid drug, as habitual as your afternoon snack.",

    "title": "Global Sustainability",
    "info": "Despite understanding the consequences of not acting to curb unsustainability, why do people fail to act? Human’s behavioral apathy toward sustainability may be due to an inaccurate characterization of sustainability and/or a lack of understanding of cultural diversity and behavior. Therefore, an understanding of the human behavior will contribute greatly to (i) decipher human actions that negatively impact global ecosystems, (ii) slowdown or stop human ecologically destructive trajectory, and (iii) promote sustainable alternatives. The problem is that environmental issues are not generally included in psychology programs, and psychology is not often represented in environmental programs. In the United Nation’s (UN) Sustainable Development goals 2030 (UN SDG 2030), psychological indices have been conspicuously absent (except for mental health in general terms) even though environmental degradation, social or economic inequity, all are implicated by human behavior. The UN SDG 2030 is based on the unproven concept that sustainability is an intersection of social, economic and environmental factors, the key pillars of sustainability. Since economic activity and society are subsets of human behavior, psychology should be considered central to unsustainability and/or sustainability. Therefore, we hypothesize that behavioral psychology has a critical role to play in creating a sustainable society. The aim of the proposed GCC is to discuss (un)sustainability using this new paradigm that will allow new approaches to achieve transition from unsustainability to sustainability worldwide. The specific aims of the proposed GCC are following: (i) Describe interaction between sustainability and behavioral psychology as the 4th pillar of sustainability. (ii) Explain the behavioral correlates of cultural differences in terms of transition to sustainability. (iii) Explain the consumption (related to unsustainability) and conservation (related to sustainability) behavior. (iv) Determine the place of Psychology in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that are mostly based on Sociology, Economy and Environment. (v) Describe humanity’s transition from unsustainable to sustainable development. \n\nThis is a Grand Challenge Curriculum Course.

    "title": "Higher Ed & Mass Incarceration",
    "info": "The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world. We have just 5% of the world’s population, but 25% of its prisoners. Since 1970, the number of incarcerated persons in this country has increased by 700%. Of the 2.3 million people currently in prison or jail, however, just 6 percent have access to higher education. Indeed, contemporary higher education policy and infrastructure disregards incarcerated individuals as potential postsecondary students.  Even as colleges and universities across the country champion diversity-driven and inclusivity-oriented mission statements, and look to create viable postsecondary pathways for systemically underserved students, only a handful include incarcerated and justice-impacted individuals in these efforts.  The University of Minnesota is not currently among them. \n\nThis course will explore the intersection of higher education and mass incarceration in the United States with a focus on the role of higher education in disrupting the collateral consequences of incarceration and justice involvement. In particular, we will examine the potential for the University of Minnesota to play a pivotal role in disrupting what we call the “ripple effect” of incarceration and justice involvement on individuals and communities in Minnesota. Students will have an opportunity to tour local correctional facilities and both hear from and present to experts in the field, including formerly incarcerated people. In addition, students’ ideas will directly inform a “college in prisons” program that is being developed by Professors Moriearty and Shlafer, in collaboration with other University scholars and administrators, and the Minnesota Department of Corrections. In this way, students’ work in this class and their projects will directly and meaningfully inform the real world and the development of the college in prisons program in “real time.” \n\nAs a teaching team with expertise in law, juvenile justice, criminal justice, child welfare, psychology, and public health, Professors Moriearty and Shlafer will highlight examples of successful interdisciplinary collaborations from their own research and practice experience. In addition, students will hear from guest lecturers from multiple disciplines and affiliations (including an Assistant Commissioner and educational expert at the Minnesota Department of Corrections and law, public heath, arts, information technology and sociology instructors from the University) and panels of stakeholders, policy-makers and formerly incarcerated/justice impacted individuals.\n\nThis is a Grand Challenge Curriculum course.

Designing games challenges students to examine systems, identify leverage points, confront trade-offs, and be creative. In doing so, it prepares them to become system teachers, leveraging organizations and networks for change. We invite students from a range of backgrounds to apply their disciplinary expertise and interests in new ways.

The class will focus on how each student's personal and disciplinary identities intersect with society’s needs and on creating a common vocabulary, grounding students in natural elemental cycles, differing perspectives on circularity and resource use, and the importance of the co-creation of solutions. Key foci are introducing experimental analytical strategies, and basic tools and mechanisms to achieve and interrogate circularity, such as principles of green engineering, lifecycle assessment, economic and policy tools, and after-progress narratives. Case studies, social practice art interventions, and a group project will be used to demonstrate how science and technology, policy, and expansive community/stakeholder knowledge all are important aspects of developing and re-conceptualizing sustainable solutions to problems in water, material, and energy use. The course compliments a new National Science Foundation-sponsored Research Trainee Program with a circularity theme.",

    "info": "This course provides an intensive, hands-on experience designing and developing a sustainable intervention to an aspect of a Grand Challenge. In other words, converting knowledge to impact. The target audience is students and student teams who have identified and/or worked on a specific problem in a previous GCC course and wish to dig deeper in developing a project plan. \n\nStudents should enter the class with a problem statement identifying the challenge they aim to address, a target location or community, and a proposed solution or intervention that they wish to develop. Student solutions should address a problem that is about a broadly defined Grand Challenge; examples of applicable areas include water, immigration and refugees, energy, housing, educational opportunity gap, public health, food and sustainable agriculture. Ideas outside this range are also acceptable. \n\nBy the end of class, students will create a plausible design and implementation plan for a solution that addresses their self-created Grand Challenge problem statement. This solution or intervention could take many forms, depending on student interest and problem statement. Business or nonprofit plans, policy and advocacy plans, media and awareness campaigns and activism plans are all possible. Determining the correct path(s) is part of the learning objectives for the course. Students will leave the course with a completed preliminary pitch deck for their plan in order to make the case for initial, or seed stage, support. \n\nThroughout this document (and course), the terms solution and intervention will be used somewhat interchangeably. This reflects the fact that different disciplines use different words to describe similar aspects of the overall process covered in this class. Understanding some of those differences is part of the learning objectives for the class.\n\nThis is a Grand Challenge Curriculum course.
