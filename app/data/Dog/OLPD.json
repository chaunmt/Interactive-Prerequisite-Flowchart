    "info": "Life - like leadership - is full of paradoxes.  We are all individuals.  At the same time, we are all part of families, communities, institutions, structures, and systems.  To understand and practice effective leadership, we must make sense of our lives - including our unique identities and experiences - within these broader organizational and societal contexts.  We must think critically about how power flows through society, and how it shapes agency, opportunities and wellbeing for individuals and communities.  And we must think creatively and critically about how leadership can help promote equity, justice, and human flourishing.\nIn this course, we focus on organizations as a core context for leadership.  Organizations are everywhere -  some formal, some informal.  For example, we are all part of an educational organization: the University of Minnesota.  We all interact with governmental organizations at national, state, and local levels.  We may belong to community, religious, or cultural organizations.  We might work - now or in the future - for a corporation, a nonprofit, or a cooperative.  We may belong to an advocacy organization that works for social change.\nTo study leadership within these various types of organizations, we must also turn inward to examine our own identities, social locations, and experiences.  We draw on concepts and theories - from the fields of leadership development, organizational studies, sociology, and psychology - to analyze our lived experiences within broader contexts, and better understand the behaviors of individuals and groups within organizations.\nThis course will require active engagement with course materials, your classmates, and class projects.  Our class sessions will include group activities, student-driven discussions, and the occasional mini-lecture.  We will explore case studies and individual narratives as touchstones for applying theory to real world contexts.  Over the semester, you will complete both individual and group assignments, including reflective writing and class facilitation.  Ultimately, this course is a \\\"learning lab\\\" where we have the chance to practice being how we would like the world to be.\nOld: Students examine own views of leadership, differences between ",

Do literature,\nfilm and other media accurately reflect both our legal system and how lawyers are trained and the work\nthat they do, or do they rely upon outdated, stereotypical, or sensationalized portrayals? We will also\nconsider whether literature, film, and popular culture can actually be useful in helping us better\ncomprehend the complexities and ethics of the law in all of its often frustrating ambiguity. Students will\nhave the opportunity to develop their skills in research, analysis, oral communication, and creativity\nthrough writing formal papers, participating in and leading class discussions, making presentations,\nwriting stories and poems, and completing a group project. At the end of this course, you will be better\nable to analyze complex social problems and make informed decisions regarding the important legal and\nethical issues we face as a society. In that way, this course meets an important central goal of a liberal\neducation: to help you become a more informed, aware, and engaged citizen. ",

Accordingly, it emphasizes links between research purposes, the conceptualization of case study projects, and the development of researchable questions. It also takes up a variety of ethical and political issues related to working with participants during the research process, as\nwell as contemporary trustworthiness criteria for case study reports. The bulk of the course is given to training in observation, generating field notes, interviewing, collecting material cultural artifacts, using surveys, and analyzing, interpreting, and writing up case study data. The first segment of the course focuses on a critical discussion of research paradigms and epistemological assumptions of a variety of case study approaches. Students choose and critique a published case study from their field of interest. The second part of the course is devoted to a very small scale\ncase study project which students design and carry out themselves. This project is supported by relevant readings and in-class activities (including peer review) related to the actual conduct of case study research.",

Module 1 begins with an overview of some of the primary sources of oppression in the West and the Global South. Here, we cover material on varying epistemologies, the nature of bias, critical self-reflection, and schools, space, and identity. In Module 2, we will examine how these oppressive practices and systems exist in the modern era. We look then at how they enter institutions and how they are reproduced. This includes an examination of various types of bigotry and discrimination in school. In Module 3, we begin to look at how these histories and complex, dynamic systems of power, privilege, and oppression enter and express in schools and communities. We move from the individual to the collective as we explore the many divides between school and community people and perspectives. In Modules 4 and 5, we finally look at emancipatory, liberatory, and culturally responsive models of schooling.  In this last part of the course, we look at how community-based and indigenous knowledge can be used to inform schooling. Here, we dig deep into culturally responsive leadership practice, spending time unpacking 4 major strands of culturally responsive school leadership. We look at how curriculum, instructional leadership, PDs, and other resources are structured to improve equity in a building. We take up the community-based approaches to education. \n",

We will examine the intertwined histories of colonialism, development, and education; efforts to promote national development through the expansion of schooling; the role of development institutions in shaping education policy and practice; and several current issues in the field of IED today. Throughout, we will consider different perspectives on how, and whether, education can foster better lives for people around the world.",

The course first introduces students to the distinctions of qualitative longitudinal research, and the types of research problems and questions that this approach can address. The course explores the unique contributions of longitudinal research to understanding change, time and continuity. The course then focuses on several research methods' ethnography, life histories, and multiple interviews/observations that are used in qualitative longitudinal research, and the distinct and unique questions that longitudinal approaches using these methods can address. Using existing qualitative longitudinal datasets, students will then engage in different approaches and levels of qualitative longitudinal analyses. The course supports students in the analysis processes of qualitative data that they may use for their own research studies. Students will also produce a final paper of a mini-research project, including the qualitative longitudinal research questions, theoretical framework, approach and analyses they have used.\nprereq: Graduate Student. Requires foundational qualitative research knowledge eg., OLPD 5056 Case Studies; OLPD 5061 Ethnographic Research Methods or CI 8148 Conducting Qualitative Studies in Educat Contexts",
