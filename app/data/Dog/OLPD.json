families, communities, institutions, structures, and systems.  to understand and practice effective leadership, we must make sense of our lives - including our unique identities and experiences - within these broader organizational and societal contexts.  we must think critically about how power flows through society, and how it shapes agency, opportunities and wellbeing for individuals and communities.  and we must think creatively and critically about how leadership can help promote equity, justice, and human flourishing.\nin this course, we focus on organizations as a core context for leadership.  organizations are everywhere -  some formal, some informal.  for example, we are all part of an educational organization: the university of minnesota.  we all interact with governmental organizations at national, state, and local levels.  we may belong to community, religious, or cultural organizations.  we might work - now or in the future - for a corporation, a nonprofit, or a cooperative.  we may belong to an advocacy organization that works for social change.\nto study leadership within these various types of organizations, we must also turn inward to examine our own identities, social locations, and experiences.  we draw on concepts and theories - from the fields of leadership development, organizational studies, sociology, and psychology - to analyze our lived experiences within broader contexts, and better understand the behaviors of individuals and groups within organizations.\nthis course will require active engagement with course materials, your classmates, and class projects.  our class sessions will include group activities, student-driven discussions, and the occasional mini-lecture.  we will explore case studies and individual narratives as touchstones for applying theory to real world contexts.  over the semester, you will complete both individual and group assignments, including reflective writing and class facilitation.  ultimately, this course is a \\\"learning lab\\\" where we have the chance to practice being how we would like the world to be.\nold: students examine own views of leadership, differences

indigenous communities (broadly defined and in\nrelation with more than humans), cultural practices, knowledges, and in and out-of-school education.\n\nwe pay particular attention to local indigenous educational experiences and in broader global\ncontexts, which are examined using chronological (histories/time), thematic (topical yet interconnected ideas), and vital approaches (issues requiring urgent attention and their interventions), including analysis of trajectories of indigenous education, the expansion of mass schooling, education/language ideologies and policies, and resistance, innovation, and indigenous-driven resurgence through educational design. the course assumes indigenous education as part of an array\nof anti- and decolonial strategies for indigenous self-determination that is inextricable from good\nhuman-earth relations; thus, as a class, we take a holistic and connective approach towards\nunderstanding education as part of indigenous knowledge systems.\n\nthe course also assumes diverse forms and definitions of education and epistemologies (the study of knowledge/how we know what we know) proposed by indigenous and critical scholars. we therefore examine a) the formal schooling of indigenous children historically designed by non-indigenous\ngroups, b) education as ancestral birthright/indigenous socialization and nature-mediated (kawagley, 2006), and c) education as advancing indigenous sovereign pedagogies (goodyear-ka??pua, 2013). further, the course expands understanding of the links and disruptions between different educational practices, in and out-of-school and across diverse geographies, communities,\nand ideas and practices of peoplehood?from u.s. american indian and alaska native communities to indigenous communities in the highland andes to pacific island nations and beyond.\n\ncentral to student work in this course is learning how indigenous communities shape learning\nexperiences according to place relations and how indigenous knowledge systems are foundational in this work. three organizing concepts assist in this course?s design, reflected through readings and lectures: we pay attention to patterns in policies impacting indigenous peoples with special attention to explicit environmental/land, language, and educational development; we consider the role of\nfamilies, communities, and place-based pedagogies in formal and out-of-school education; and we exercise creative educational proposals for indigenous self-determination and self-development that are linked with indigenous educational research. students are asked to carefully examine contexts of the education of indigenous peoples under local, national and transnational pressures and amidst\nother variables, specifically economic and political shifts, environmental development-degradation, and climate change and to offer their own proposals toward transformative indigenous education design and research agendas that inform educational development in and with indigenous peoples?meaning, the course is most interested in cultivating dialogue and exchanging ideas because there are\nno singular, closed, or universal solutions to indigenous environmental challenges and educational design as interventions.\n\nfor students interested in topics related to identified course themes, please note that the course has a strong environmental and land-based foundation and is linked with these keywords: indigenous knowledge systems, land kinship, place-based education and more than human relations, nature-mediated education, traditional ecological knowledge, indigenous community-based education, indigenous language reclamation, and decolonial educational research and design. students are\ninvited to cultivate their own focal areas in relation to prior knowledge and current study interests.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"OLPD

begins with an overview of some of the primary sources of oppression in the west and the global south. here, we cover material on varying epistemologies, the nature of bias, critical self-reflection, and schools, space, and identity. in module 2, we will examine how these oppressive practices and systems exist in the modern era. we look then at how they enter institutions and how they are reproduced. this includes an examination of various types of bigotry and discrimination in school. in module 3, we begin to look at how these histories and complex, dynamic systems of power, privilege, and oppression enter and express in schools and communities. we move from the individual to the collective as we explore the many divides between school and community people and perspectives. in modules 4 and 5, we finally look at emancipatory, liberatory, and culturally responsive models of schooling.  in this last part of the course, we look at how community-based and indigenous knowledge can be used to inform schooling. here, we dig deep into culturally responsive leadership practice, spending time unpacking 4 major strands of culturally responsive school leadership. we look at how curriculum, instructional leadership, pds, and other resources are structured to improve equity in a building. we take up the community-based approaches to

following:\nunderstanding of broad historical events, including the political, cultural, religious, psychological, and economic factors that shaped higher education in regions and countries across the world;\nknowledge about the role of the federal government in shaping the structure of the higher education system in specific countries;\nunderstanding of the process of internationalization as it

sociopolitical factors that drive internationalization in higher education institutions.\n\nno single course can address all of the topics related to international higher education. in this course, the following seven primary questions serve as the focus for an analysis of international higher education: \n1) what are the most significant historical factors that shaped higher education in a specific country, and to what extent do those country-specific historical factors help understand higher education in the region? \n2) what is the role of the federal government in a country, and to what extent are within-country differences analogous to differences among states in the united states? \n3) how is higher education financed within a country, and are there regional economic forces that affect countries in the region? \n4) what is the structure of higher education in the country (e.g., public institutions, private non-profit institutions, and for-profit institutions)? \n5) what
