They have enabled organizations to increase efficiency, reduce costs, and reach new customers. Their impact goes beyond the business world and affects nearly every aspect of modern society. Along with the benefits they provide, technologies have created new problems around privacy, security, misinformation on social media, algorithmic bias, and potential stifling of competition and innovation. In today's digital age, it is crucial to develop an understanding of information technologies, their impact on business and society, and the challenges they pose for decision making in commercial firms, government agencies, and public policies.  ",

Typical data engineering tasks may include data acquisition, parsing, handling missing data, summarization, augmenting, transformation, subsetting, sampling, aggregation, and merging. Data engineers also frequently use basic data visualization tools to detect and fix data issues. Most recently, there is increasing demand for data engineers to handle big data and unstructured data. A good data engineering process ensures quality, reliability, and usability of data. In fact, data engineering is such a critical and time-consuming step of data-driven decision making that many data scientists and analysts spend more than 60% of their time doing data engineering related tasks.",
