    "info": "This course is designed to prepare advanced undergraduates and graduate students to more effectively engage issues of disability in public history. This class is rooted in activism, taking an intersectional approach, which will push students to reflect on the numerous ways other forms of identity intersect and have been classified as disability. This class is organized as a workshop where students from multiple disciplines will focus on strategies for increasing public awareness and understanding of disability histories as expressed in American buildings and landscapes. The class will be grounded in scholarly and activist perspectives on disability justice connected with various aspects of public history: historic preservation, archival practices, community-engaged work, and exhibition design, among others.",

    "info": "This seminar will explore the changes in how diversity has been represented in historical interpretations in the past, and how practice is changing in response to the contemporary and anticipated social context of the United States. \\\"Diversity\\\" has historically been assumed to derive from categories such as race or culture, concepts constructed in the discipline of anthropology but taken up as the foundation for typologies in other arenas such as art history, architectural history, museums, and public policy. What is problematic in such an approach?  What happens to communities defined by shared history, political sovereignty, and disenfranchisement? What are the implications beyond museums for those communities? Finally, how can we think differently about diversity without re-inscribing harmful constructions of difference? ",

Topics to be presented by speakers may include: making history accessible and meaningful to increasingly diverse audiences; interpreting difficult or traumatic histories; gathering, storing, and providing access to physical collections in a digital age; engaging the public in historical research and interpretation; the financial management and leadership of historical organizations. The course has several objectives: students will learn from, and have the opportunity to meet, leaders of historical organizations located throughout Minnesota and the United States; it will also be a cohort-building opportunity as students in the first and second years of the program meet regularly in this course to hear from professional practitioners and discuss presentations and readings.",

    "prereqInfo": "This course privileges hands-on learning and balances deeping essential methodological skills\nwith exposure to a breadth of field-altering technologies. It is structured around five core\nmethodologies--excavation, documentation, reconstruction, interpretation, and exhibition. In\neach unit, students will be first be tasked with identifying the underlying principles of these\nmethodological approaches. They will then use class time to explore technologies that extend\nthose methods such as high-resolution imaging, relational databases, text mining programs,\nvirtual environments, and content management systems for website building. Bookending the\ncourse is a focus on effective collaboration--the foundation of successful digital projects--and\npublic engagement in an increasingly connected yet fractured society.",

In this course, students will gain experience with archival theory, archival ethics, selection, appraisal, arrangement, description, reference, access, preservation, exhibits, and outreach.  Through engaging with those topics, students will be prepared to situate archives and archival material within the socio-historical contexts in which they were produced and in which they are maintained, affording them a critical perspective on the historical sources they contain.
