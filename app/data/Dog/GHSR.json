The discipline of social medicine provides a theoretical and practical framework to explore these topics. Social medicine is an approach to health that recognizes the centrality of the social and structural determination of health, integrates social theory to understand social forces that marginalize and harm communities, and builds collective power to challenge oppression and support the struggle for social justice. The course uses an experiential and inter-professional model; global, collaborative participation will promote understanding of the ways in which globally-connected social forces impact experience in local settings in similar and different ways.",
