    "title": "Migrants/Refugees in Film",
    "info": "This course deals with films made in France, Spain, Italy, the Maghreb (Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia), sub-Saharan Africa and the Levant (mostly Syria). All of the films tackle migration and most of them deal with the crossing of the Mediterranean  Sea in particular. It focuses on how migrants, regular and clandestine migrations, as well as related themes, including globalization, hospitality and transnational modes of transportation have been filmed, discussed and written about in various types of discourses. \n\nWhy and how do people emigrate? Where are the major destinations of migrants? What is Fortress Europe? What is the “global South?” What is the so-called refugee crisis? Who is a refugee? What impact has the Arab Spring had on contemporary migrations to Europe? How does mass media portray the global South? What do political discourses tell us about the European and North African handlings of recent human migratory movements? Can artists effectively put forward an alternate take on such issues? What types of responses in artistic productions as well as in the political and humanitarian arenas have failed attempts at crossing the Mediterranean Sea triggered? These are some of the questions we will address. Among the films that we will analyze—all shown in class—are Chus Gutiérrez’s Return to Hansala, Reem Kherici’s Paris or Perish, Ismaël Ferroukhi’s The Grand Voyage and Gianfranco Rosi’s Fire at Sea. \n\nAll films have English subtitles. The class will be conducted in English.",

    "info": "What makes Victor Hugo's 1862 Les Misérables such an enduring novel that it has been adapted over a hundred times from European movies to Japanese anime, a graphic novel from India, and a telenovela from Mexico - and of course one of the most successful musicals ever created? In this class we will read the unabridged novel in English translation (1,400 pages!) through a technique called Split Reading and Group Summaries, where each student reads only about 250 pages.\n\nTo answer what makes this novel unique, we will organize research teams that will investigate in depth key aspects of the novel within a forensic and archaeological approach. What was the situation of the working classes in Europe by mid-19th-century? Why are criminality, foster parentage, policing, enrichment, and revolution so closely intertwined? Where is the particular creativity of Hugo in sketching this immense panorama of Paris and France at the threshold of modernity?\n\nWith the novel and its film and musical adaptations as focus, we will discover and probe the methods at our disposal to assess and represent the past as a living reality. We will work mostly through Reading Groups and Research Groups (which will set some of our secondary readings). At the end of the semester each student will offer a creative retort to Les Misérables in the form, media and tone of their choice.",

    "title": "Existentialism",
    "info": "What do we mean when we call something \\\"existential?\\\"  What do we mean when we speak of an \\\"existential\\\" crisis? We seem to mean that our core beliefs and assumptions are affected and the relationship with our environment is ruptured; we have fallen out of normalcy. The term existentialism -- turning existential into a noun -- came into being in the 1940s in France, reflecting the collective experience of societal breakdown, of Nazism, and WW2. It has since been applied to all modes of philosophical inquiry that take an individual's experience of alienation from society as their point of departure. The advantage of making alienation the focus of this class, too, is that it allows us to recognize the precise historical and sociological index of the emergence of an existentialist mode of thought and practice. Existentialism looks very different when it responds to a 19th century crisis of faith (Søren Kierkegaard), to 1950s colonialism (Frantz Fanon), to Weimar Germany's new democracy and the specter of a mass society (Martin Heidegger), or to the neo-authoritarian French society of the 1960s (Simone de Beauvoir). Existentialism then is understood in this class not as a conversation between great thinkers or ideas across time and space, but as a response to a specific crisis of norms and values. It only exists in plural. If existentialist concepts -- like being-in-the world, being-towards-death, or the gaze of the other -- are carried forward, then not without being repurposed. Such situatedness is inherent to existentialism itself. Accordingly, existentialist writers have no creed or ethical stance in common; they are found both on the far (fascist) right and on the Marxist left. They do share though a keen interest in a new language and in literary forms of expression and subsequently, they insist on the individuals' capacity of \\\"world-making\\\" -- in rupture and rebellion -- against seemingly compromised societal norms.",
