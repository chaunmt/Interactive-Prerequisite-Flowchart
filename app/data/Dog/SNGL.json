As background to the course, we will attempt to create a common understanding of key concepts such as human rights, social justice, human services, social services, social welfare, community development, and social work.  Students will then look at how these ideals are implemented in Senegal and the limitations and challenges of the implementation.",

A critical reflection on the limits of microfinance as a durable development approach will allow students to better understand attempts at innovation that respond to specific problems related to microfinance, and the course will introduce them to diverse perspectives on microfinance in the contemporary global economy. Students will engage with topics such as microfinance, social entrepreneurship, access to capital, and financial services.",

Students will consider a variety of solutions to these challenges, wrestle with the questions of balance between practical needs and preservation, and propose ways to best implement these solutions in the Senegalese value context.

Students will examine the human past, study the beliefs, practices, and relationships that shaped the human experience over time in Senegal.  Students will analyze the place of Senegal in the broader West African sub region; discuss the physical and human resources available for Senegal’s development and the major challenges and constraints it faces; and take a critical look at the country’s economic policy and political system.\n\nStudents will discuss Senegalese cultures, cultural values, arts, and lifestyles using literature, visuals, and the performing arts. They will consider how literature forges the conscience of a nation and how the encouragement of thriving artistic expression can help the development efforts and the carving of a national identity.",

The course does this by introducing various topics in the research cycle and providing a forum in which students can share with one another their research experience at each stage of the process. Students will learn to develop, defend, and challenge their own values and beliefs\n\nResearch projects in this course are ideally projects that fit with the development agency’s goals and activities; therefore, the student’s research interests must blend with what is realistically happening at the development agency. Students must have approved proposals before proceeding onto their research sites to allow them collect necessary data and complete data analysis before heading back to Dakar at the end of the six-week field period. It is likely that students will participate in field activities, meetings, and other forms of engagement that will be indirectly related to and could inform their research projects. Students will be presented with concrete opportunities to identify and apply their knowledge of ethics, both in solving short-term problems and in creating long-term forecasts. \n\nAs stated on the MSID website, the governments of the United States and MSID countries have laws protecting human subjects of research. Due to the timeline for gaining the necessary permissions for doing research with human subjects, such research cannot be conducted while abroad on LAC programs. However, there are still a wide variety of projects, that include interaction with people, that are available. See more information on options for Undergraduate Research Abroad.\n\nThe course will also include 15 hours of French or Wolof instruction to prepare students with practical vocabulary for the workplace.",

The course focuses on guiding students to understand their own identity as they integrate theory with reality through participation in local development sites. Students are prepared for entering into their community work through discussions on stakeholder and agency analysis, culture specific gender and diversity context, and power and privilege.  Students will learn to develop, defend, and challenge their own values and beliefs\n\nThe mentoring continues while students are at their internship placement. They come in contact with social actors, community organizations, and local and national authorities in various regions of Dakar at the marginal urban and rural levels. The students are urged to play an active role in their internships by providing suggestions and solutions, discussing alternatives, and investigating all areas of their internship placement to garner a holistic experience of the realities of development work. Through practical internship experiences as well as readings, discussions, and written assignments, students will deepen their understanding of the host-country cultural context and development work from an international perspective, as well as critically examine their own worldview. Students will be presented with concrete opportunities to identify and apply their knowledge of ethics, both in solving short-term problems and in creating long-term forecasts.\n\nThe course will also include 15 hours of French or Wolof instruction to give students practical vocabulary for the workplace.\n",
