research concepts and practices; make decisions involved in research, including selecting a topic and title for their study, developing statements of problems, and choosing research questions and appropriate research design; learn about issues related to research ethics; and develop their skills in choosing data collection instruments and analysis of the data they collect for their research. the course does this by introducing various topics in the research cycle and providing a forum in which students can share with one another their research experience at each stage of the process. students will learn to develop, defend, and challenge their own values and beliefs\n\nresearch projects in this course are ideally projects that fit with the development agency’s goals and activities; therefore, the student’s research interests must blend with what is realistically happening at the development agency. students must have approved proposals before proceeding onto their research sites to allow them collect necessary data and complete data analysis before heading back to dakar at the end of the six-week field period. it is likely that students will participate in field activities, meetings, and other forms of engagement that will be indirectly related to and could inform their research projects. students will be presented with concrete opportunities to identify and apply their knowledge of ethics, both in solving short-term problems and in creating long-term forecasts. \n\nas stated on the msid website, the governments of the united states and msid countries have laws protecting human subjects of research. due to the timeline for gaining the necessary permissions for doing research with human subjects, such research cannot be conducted while abroad on lac programs. however, there are still a wide variety of projects, that include interaction with people, that are available. see more information on options for undergraduate research abroad.\n\nthe course will
