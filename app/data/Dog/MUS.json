What is its meaning in our lives, why does it matter, which realities does it touch, how can it be communicated? In what way is it distributed between intellect and emotions? And why do we go to concerts, since electronic media and the internet provide such easy access? The answers will be approached via intensive listening to all kinds of music from different cultures and epochs as well as through critical, very open discussions with the students.

That will mean looking in detail at musical parameters that include chord progressions, melodic trajectory, rhythmic nuance, and instrumentation, but neither the ability to read music nor any previous knowledge of music theory is required.\n\nAmong the earliest material under consideration will be songs like Carole King’s 1960 “Will You Love Me Tomorrow,\\\" which displays an ingenious, deeply compelling encounter with a basic 32-bar “ballad” form that had been in circulation for decades. Among the latest will be songs like Kendrick Lamar’s 2015 “King Kunta,” whose successive verses stage an incremental increase of rhythmic activity so dramatic and propulsive as to leave the very idea of a succession of “verses”—that undergirding principle of pop-song repetition—in question. This pair provides some sense of the breadth of material under discussion.",

    "info": "This course examines the variety of ways African and African Americans express social history through music. It will consider the union of African elements and European elements that combined to present a new syncretized African-American product. To do this it is imperative that we explore the diversity of musical \\\"voices\\\" found within the African American culture. This diversity can be seen in the struggles to retain African cultural effects and the desire to be eclectic, creative, and contemporary. Such an approach to the study of the place of Black music in American music corresponds with the criteria of Diversity and Social Justice in the United States Liberal Education. The \\\"multi-layered operation of power, prestige, and privilege\\\" can be understood through an examination of the music of African Americans, which represents both a Free African voice and an enslaved African voice; the western-trained Black performer/composer and the self-taught performer/composer. It also represents the habits of well-to-do African Americans and the poor African Americans. Students will examine the complexities of the history of African Americans and how this is played out in the development of musical styles and genres. From this, students will then begin to understand how this unique diversity within a community affects those outside of those communities. Such an approach to the study of the place of Black music in American music corresponds with the criteria of Diversity and Social Justice in the United States Liberal Education.\n\n We will follow elements found in West African culture and music such as \\\"call and response\\\" and the \\\"2nd Line\\\" as they travel to the \\\"New World\\\" and expressed through Spirituals, Symphonies, Gospel Music, Jazz, Rock and Roll, Step Bands and more. Through lectures, readings, discussion, audiovisual examples, and homework assignments student can expect to gain a deeper understanding of the ways music both reflects and influences the social history of all Americans.",

Like any viable form of music, popular music is also a living practice, and hence our engagement with popular music will also require us to be in contact with practitioners of popular music here in the Twin Cities. Finally, the course will require students to engage with popular music in a number of ways—transcription, analysis, aural skills, ethnography (of a modest sort), composition, performance, and expository writing. The class begins with basic parameters as explored in rock music (which, for the purposes of this class, overlaps with classic R&B/soul), then moves backwards to various origination points for rock in American popular music, and then pursues various different topics for the remainder of the course.\n\nprereq: [MUS 3501, MUS 3511] with a grade of C- or better",

Like any viable form of music, popular music is also a living practice, and hence our engagement with popular music will also require us to be in contact with practitioners of popular music here in the Twin Cities. Finally, the course will require students to engage with popular music in a number of ways: transcription, analysis, aural skills, ethnography (of a modest sort), composition, performance, and expository writing. The class is in part organized around basic parameters as explored in rock/pop music (form, timbre, harmony, rhythm, etc.) and otherwise around selected focused topics of study (individual artists or genres, specific research questions, etc.). \n\nprereq: undergraduate- MUS 1502 and MUS 1512 with grade of at least C- or higher\ngraduate- MUS 3508 and MUS 3518 with grade of at least C- or higher, or passing score on tonal entrance exams.",

For musicians, the interplay of unconscious habits and the body mechanics of daily use of the self strongly affect tone production and technique.

Most assignments and reading will involve close analysis of particular songs and artists. Students will also hone aural skills through transcription work and performance/music making opportunities. The class is not guided by chronology, but instead by musical parameters as an analytical focus (e.g. timbre, form etc.). The semester closes with a final research project on a topic of the student's choice. ",

Indeed, political \\\"voice\\\" is often exercised silently (voting, letter writing, silent protest), and submission to political authority is often affirmed vocally (through pledges, songs, and oaths.) This course proceeds optimistically, in the hope that we can find our way through this vocal thicket through historical and ethnographic study, close listening, acoustical analysis, and experimental performance.
