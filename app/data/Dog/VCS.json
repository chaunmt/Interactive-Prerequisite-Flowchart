    "title": "Cancer in Society & Technology",
    "info": "The course objectives are to discuss why cancer happens, the impact that cancer has on our society, and how we can use science and technology to defeat it.\n\nFor most people, cancer is a mysterious and fearsome condition. This emotional response means that social stigmas are often tied to a cancer diagnosis. However, at its core cancer is a disease caused by mutations in a cellâ€™s DNA. In fact, the same mechanisms of mutations in DNA that lead cells to become cancerous are the drivers of evolution, so cancer risk can be considered as part of our evolutionary legacy. Moreover, few people realize that advances in cancer research and treatment are allowing millions of people (and pets) to lead healthy and fulfilling lives as cancer survivors. \n\nWe will discuss the biological and evolutionary foundations for why cancer happens and advances in how we detect it, treat, and prevent it. The course is designed for students from all majors, and non-scientists are encouraged to enroll and participate. A better understanding by scientists and non-scientists alike of the risks for cancer, of its possible occurrence in virtually all animals, and of advances in diagnosis and treatment, will help demystify this condition and allow students to converse about it in an objective fashion. \n\nWe have the tools to create a world where we no longer fear cancer, and our goal is to enroll motivated students from the University of Minnesota who will help us achieve this vision.\n",
