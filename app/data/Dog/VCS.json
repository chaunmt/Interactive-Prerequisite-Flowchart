    "prereqInfo": "for most people, cancer is a mysterious and fearsome condition. this emotional response means that social stigmas are often tied to a cancer diagnosis. however, at its core cancer is a disease caused by mutations in a cellâ€™s dna. in fact, the same mechanisms of mutations in dna that lead cells to become cancerous are the drivers of evolution, so cancer risk can be considered as part of our evolutionary legacy. moreover, few people realize that advances in cancer research and treatment are allowing millions of people (and pets) to lead healthy and fulfilling lives as cancer survivors.
