with recent assaults on traditional political institutions in the united states have raised concerns about the fate and future of democracy. political scientists largely agree that the united states has become more democratic over the past two centuries, but results from the authoritarian warning survey, a democratic-monitoring project, highlight the erosion of democratic principles and institutions in the past few years. concerns about the meaning, nature, promise, stability or instability of democracy are, however, not new. in order to better understand contemporary threats to democracy this course explores how the meanings and understandings of democracy changed over the last few centuries by examining the complicated relationship between democracy, populism and racial nationalism. is democracy a product of populism or imperilled by populism? what is the contemporary and historical relationship between democracy and racial nationalism? this seminar delves deeply into these questions by exploring a series of moments when the meanings and promise of democracy were contested. it begins with fundamental questions about the racial and gendered origins of american democracy. what is the relationship between the democratic state, the slave state and the settler colonial state? how did racial nationalism constitute and imperil american democracy from its origins? populists, that is members of mass movements that claim to speak for “the people,” have struggled to both extend and redefine the limits of democracy. in these efforts, “citizens” have frequently been pitted against non-citizens making questions of immigration, naturalization, and detention central to contestations over democracy and its perceived threats. moreover, in the united states, the relationship between detention and democracy can not be fully explored without paying significant attention to the rise of mass incarceration over the past half century. to what extent is the democratic state today threatened or maintained through the carceral state? \n\nstudent will engage with these issues through interdisciplinary lectures, course readings and discussions, and conversations with scholars, activists and organizations fostering democratic values and racial justice.\n\nthis course comes out of the democracy under threat interdisciplinary collaborative workshop. students will be invited to all democracy under threat events during the 2019-2020 academic year, including a spring 2020 conference, “democracy under threat in times of populism and racial nationalism” that will be held at the university of minnesota in partnership with howard university, morehouse college, and spelman college.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"SOC

students to new zealand society in a 3-week global seminar, covering political structures, indigenous rights, immigration trends, and environmental politics. new zealand is one of the world's most remote inhabited land-masses, and this remoteness has had a significant impact on its environmental and human history. like the united states, new zealand is thought of as a \\\"settler society\\\" that is now largely populated by descendants of people who migrated from europe in the last couple of centuries. like the united states it is a long-established democracy, with significant levels of immigration from europe and asia. unlike the united states, the indigenous maori population comprise around 1/6 of the population giving indigenous issues an unusual prominence in politics and society compared to peer countries such as the us, canada, australia, or scandinavia to which nz is often compared by social scientists. the predominant language spoken in the country is english, giving students the ability to quickly engage with the local population in formal and informal settings, and access local resources for study such as libraries, archives, speakers from universities, civic organizations, and government. \n\nthematically the course has a continuing focus on indigenous rights, immigration, and the environment in a long-established democracy. methodologically the course gives students an opportunity to engage with several important social research methods including reading comparative social science that puts new zealand in context with similar countries; archival and biographical research, and social observation of public spaces. through the instructor's contacts with colleagues in new zealand, students also have the opportunity to engage in joint discussions with new zealand university students about shared assigned readings about new zealand society, and meet community members in a range of informal and formal settings. assignments have students undertake reflective journaling on their observations of new zealand, write a biographical profile from archival sources, and complete a short research paper on a topical issue of the students' choice

sociological perspectives to bear on alcohol advertising, campus drinking, and more. there are reasons why alcoholic beverages have played a role in almost all human societies. social barriers can be lowered, new friendships made, and old relationships reestablished when people get together over a drink. cultural and political battles about alcohol can also be a way to see social divisions, power struggles, and hierarchies. and of course, drinking can be a route to all sorts of bad behavior and social problems too. we look at all of this, first in historical and cross-cultural perspective and

the development of status hierarchies in small group interaction; intergroup relations, prejudice, and discrimination).  we begin with a consideration of “personal structure,” emphasizing the cultural and structural variability of self-conceptions and identities, cognitive processes, and motivation, as well as the biosocial bases of action.  these may be considered individual-level “building blocks” of social psychological theories (along with emotions, attitudes, values, and ideologies).  we then address prominent theoretical perspectives in social psychology that illuminate the linkages between micro-social contexts of inequality and identity, including symbolic interactionism, exchange theory, structural social psychology (“social structure and personality”) and the social psychology of the life course. social psychological theory and research are foundational to many specialty fields in sociology, including the sociology of the family, education, health, deviance, work, social mobility, social movements, emotions, and the sociology of childhood, youth, and aging.  social psychology is also central to prominent theoretical debates in sociology surrounding the relationship between social structure and agency; individual-level identities, perceptions, motivations, goals, and strategies are both structured by the social context and affect the capacity of individuals to act agentically and to achieve their goals.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"SOC 8725","subject":"SOC","id":"8725","title":"Soc Theory Construction","info":"structure of social scientific theories, basic tools for developing/critiquing them. types of theoretical statements, concept formation, operationalization, testability. contrasts goals/methods of different theoretical perspectives.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"SOC 8731","subject":"SOC","id":"8731","title":"Sociology of Knowledge","info":"knowledge and related terms (ideology, stereotype, prejudice, belief, truth). variation of knowledge across social groups/categories (e.g., gender, race, class, generation, nationality);
