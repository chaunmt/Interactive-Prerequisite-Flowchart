How can we recover what he said and did? Why was he killed and who did it? Was there agreement about the life and words of Jesus in the earliest stages of Christianity, or were there major disagreements even then? How were the early writers about Jesus influenced by their social, political, and religious contexts? And why was it reported in the news recently that Jesus was married? In this course we examine the earliest attempts to describe Jesus and his significance in the gospel literature of the first and second centuries and beyond. We ask how historians may claim to \\\"know\\\" the \\\"facts\\\" of Jesus's life and meaning in light of these various portraits. We seek to understand how the different literary presentations of Jesus reflect their authors' social, religious, and political situations. We aim to understand in more detail the diversity of perspectives about Jesus from the earliest stage of the development of Christianity. Intended as a course of interest to all undergraduates on the Twin Cities campus. Students of any, all, or no religious background are welcome.

The Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) is full of stories, a story of the first humans in a garden accompanied by a snake; of a boat filled with animals and a devastating flood; of a tower that was supposed to reach the heavens, of women who strive to have children, and of a father who almost sacrifices his son. Does it sound familiar? All these stories are to be found in the first book of the Bible, the book of Genesis. Some of the stories are about villains, some about heroes; some stories of love and friendship, and there are endless stories of war, violence and death. The stories from Genesis do not end with the Hebrew Bible. They have been told and retold through millennia and are still part of our own cultures. In this course we will read stories from Genesis with the help of narrative analysis (through analyzing the stories’ plot, characters, and other literary strategies), we will learn some basics about how scholars today think the book of Genesis came into being, and we study examples of how stories from Genesis  have been used and reused through history all the way up to The  Handmaid's Tale and modern  disaster movies.
