In CI 1032 you join a learning community for discussing, analyzing, and making meaning of this artistic production. No prior experience is needed; come with an open mind and imagination as well as a willingness to experiment. An important emphasis in the class will be on finding your own ways to transform ordinary materials. We will introduce you to specific artistic techniques and in turn you will learn to take creative risks, think metaphorically, explore the unknown, improvise, brainstorm, and invent your own methods of working. Each of you bring to the class different kinds of knowledge and abilities. To be successful in this course you need to be willing to work hard, to explore territory that may not be familiar to you, to be reflective about what you are doing, and to learn from your diverse classmates and in turn help them achieve the same goals.\n \nThe instructors of “Creating Identities: Learning In and Through the Arts” shape the course with the assumption that identity is at the heart of educational experiences and that the habits of mind associated with the artistic production are primary vehicles for multimodal learning. We will experience how arts-based learning engenders higher order thinking, the creative process, reflection and perseverance. This course gives you the opportunity to both produce as well as analyze art in order to experience how creative expressions reveal aspects of our personal and social identities that have an impact on how we learn. Through mediums including photography, film, performance, music, painting and sculpture, we will explore how artists are influenced by cultural elements such as the built and natural environments, gender, religion, nationality, and socioeconomic status, and how artists, in turn, shape our perceptions of culture and identity. Through writing and discussion, we will consider how the arts can both reflect and impact our perceptions of identity and our reflections of ourselves as learners.\n \nAs you move further into your academic studies and your career, you will intersect with people from differing cultures and places. The work in this class will help you become more comfortable with and welcome the benefits that come with intercultural learning. Interactions with classmates and cultural production of indigenous, immigrant, international and Western artists, allows you to have a greater understanding of, appreciation for and acceptance of the ways of knowing a variety of cultures can provide, and the confidence that you can reciprocate in kind.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":{"course":[]}},{"code":"CI 1121","subject":"CI","id":"1121","title":"Education: Past and Present","info":"Students will explore diverse historical perspectives regarding educational movements in the U.S. since the Civil War.

Our focus will be on the image/word interaction, the complexity of pictorial reading/storytelling, the thematic scope and artistic techniques, and the historical overview of different approaches to visual narratives around the world. You'll be expected to read a variety of global and multicultural picturebooks and graphic novels accompanied by critical and theoretical readings. To facilitate your practical understanding of visual narratives you?ll complete several written assignments, including producing, analyzing, and revising a picture project and sequential art project.

Students will explore the ways that writers of creative nonfiction use language to examine pivotal experiences of teaching and learning in diverse contexts, and add their own voices to this rich body of work by producing their own texts. Through study of writing, students will develop familiarity with writing choices and practice employing these techniques and processes in their own writing. Students will read personal essays written by writers in the US who reflect on their own experiences and interrogate how aspects of their identities (including race, ethnicity, gender, family history and language) inform pivotal experiences of teaching and learning. Students will compose texts that explore their own experiences within a constellation of formal and informal educational settings and the questions raised and arguments made through these representations. We will use a workshop-based format that supports transformational learning, helping writers see themselves and their worlds in new ways.

Given that climate change is primarily a challenge to our story systems and that adolescents constitute the most invested audience for sustainability education, adolescent literature has become a site of rebellion against the unjust and ecocidal status quo; a site where adolescents can articulate, debate, and creatively respond to visions of sustainable futures. In this course we will study award-winning works of fiction and nonfiction across genres to understand how adolescent literature inspires activist positions vis a vis petronormative ideologies of power that are devastating the planet. Our focus on the intersection of storytelling, activism, and climate change literacy will help us grasp the key role adolescent literature plays in empowering today’s youths to become agents of change. We will discuss how adolescent literature can stoke young people’s transformative anger, inspire them to address the climate crisis, and stand up for their right to have a future. We will consider how educators can support this fight through activism and engaged discussions of adolescent literature. We will read award-winning picturebooks, novels, and graphic novels that challenge us to reinvent ourselves as a biocentric global civilization. The goal is to transform you into an informed advocate of adolescent literature as a tool for developing climate change literacy and empowering your students to imagine post-carbon futures.\n","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":{"course":[]}},{"code":"CI 5451","subject":"CI","id":"5451","title":"Teach Reading Mid/Sec Grades","info":"Methods of accommodating to students' abilities and facilitating reading in regular content classes.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":{"course":[]}},{"code":"CI 5452","subject":"CI","id":"5452","title":"Read Content Area ILP Cand","info":"Web-based course.

The most dynamic and diverse field of modern storytelling, speculative fiction serves as a catalyst, in and beyond the classroom, for radical imagination: one that contests the oppressive socio-economic system by reimagining race, gender, class, and other real-world issues. This seminar examines the cultural work performed by speculative fiction addressed to children and young adults. Engaging with stories that suggest alternatives to how we live now, students develop mental habits of global citizens who value diversity and strive for social transformation. Works of speculative fiction for the young reader are discussed as particle accelerators for ideas of change and as sites of resistance against exclusion and systemic inequalities. The focus is on speculative fiction by indigenous, minority, and postcolonial authors. Exploring the ways in which these works interrogate dominant notions of reality and structures of meaning helps students appreciate speculative fiction as a tool for imagining radical social change.
