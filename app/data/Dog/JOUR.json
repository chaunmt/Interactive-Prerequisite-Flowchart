As a survey of journalism research, students will be introduced to both classic and cutting-edge journalism research. The course explores multiple epistemic, methodological, and geographic perspectives that approach journalism as a practice, a cultural form, and an institution embedded in political and civic life. Readings will cover core debates surrounding professionalism and organizational structures, normative commitments involving objectivity and its alternatives, news audiences, race, colonialism, inclusivity, and questions arising from recent technological and economic developments. The course will also interrogate how journalism studies scholars consider their conceptual assumptions, research practices, and power. The learning objectives for this course include: introducing the fundamentals of journalism research field, and how the field has changed over the years; understanding how varying approaches to studying journalism shape and constrain how journalism is thought about; examining recent research on the impact of emerging media technologies on long-standing theoretical and conceptual underpinnings; and providing students an opportunity to conduct their own research on a journalism-related topic. The overview of journalism research that this course provides is central for students with a journalism studies focus, but it also provides a helpful background for students with journalism-adjacent focuses in strategic communication, health communication, and mass communication, political communication, and other social science foci.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":{"course":[]}},{"code":"JOUR 8620","subject":"JOUR","id":"8620","title":"Advertising Theory & Research","info":"Advertising as persuasive communication.
