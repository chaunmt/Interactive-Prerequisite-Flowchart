        "info": "The BSE major is built on the idea that problems of biology, health, and the environment emerge at the intersection of natural and human systems. Understanding these problems and their solutions, and building skill sets to address them, requires experience in the biological and natural sciences as well as in the social sciences and humanities. In this introduction to the BSE major, you’ll explore the interconnectedness of biology, society, and environment through a series of “case study” modules that include lectures, videos, readings, and discussions. You’ll also complete some very practical exercises to help you consider how you might develop your own unique path through the BSE major, in ways that are relevant to your personal and/or professional interests and goals.\n\nMust be completed prior to senior year.",

The work can be full or part time, paid or unpaid, primarily in off-campus environments. Internships integrate classroom knowledge and theory with practical application and skill development in professional or community settings. The skills and knowledge learned should be transferable to other employment settings and not simply to advance the operations of the employer. Typically the student's work is supervised and evaluated by a site coordinator or instructor. A student may only earn credit for a given internship through one course at a time.",
