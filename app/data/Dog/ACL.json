    "info": "This class is for anyone passionate about the unique capacities embedded in arts and cultural work, concerned about the cascade of challenges facing humanity, and determined to lead with and through the powerful resources of the arts and culture. Fundamental changes in organizations, programs, and resources are needed to meet the complex challenges of our times.

    "info": "The rise of the creative economy, creative cities, the creative class, and creative placemaking are generally considered unique to the 21st century. Are these new phenomena or just new brand identities for the historic role of cities as centers of cultural production and exchange? As contemporary phenomena, they have also been linked to a rise in social and economic inequities. Creativity, culture, and the role of artists are of increasing significance in the ways cities and communities are planned, form, and function. What roles can artists, activists, cultural leaders, urban planners, and other civic leaders play with regard to making cities more equitable and culturally vibrant? This course explores the evolving relationships of arts, culture, and the creative sector with city planning, development, and democractic practices. Students will hear directly from community leaders and undertake their own community change projects.",

    "title": "A Multiplicity of Ways",
    "info": "There are many different ways to experience and understand the world. Creative, culturally based forms of expression serve to expand on those ways. However, colonial practices, alive in academic, arts, and cultural environments globally, homogenize ways of knowing, understanding, and evaluating the world around us. These epistemologies are grounded in collecting data, building analysis, logic and theory that fits the data. Other ways of being, knowing, and seeing are equally meaningful, and are critical in efforts to understand the complex world we live in and create the possibility for transformational social change that is relevant to multiple human experiences and contexts. This course will guide students in developing a framework to better understand and act in meaningful and interdependent ways in the world. Students will explore concepts, worldviews and art and cultural practices from many points of view, challenging the concept of universality in favor of a multiplicity of ways of being, knowing, seeing, and doing. Students will be better prepared to address the pressing needs of arts and cultural organizations and social movements within a global and multicultural context.\n",

    "info": "Effective chief executives of nonprofit arts and cultural organizations differ most from their less effective counterparts in the ways in which they work with their boards of directors, their staff and their artistic leadership, not in their fundraising prowess or their management expertise. In fact, the degree to which nonprofit executives work in genuine partnership with their boards, staff and artistic leadership often makes the difference between successful and unsuccessful organizations. Complicating matters is the fact that while nonprofits are increasingly in need of experienced, qualified board members, there are limited opportunities for preparing new or prospective board members for board service or for developing more experienced board members into effective board leaders. Often it is the chief executive who must train the board.\n\nThis practicum has two primary areas of focus: The first is on continuing to develop your own leadership skills and values, and establishing practices that can be sustained after you graduate from the program. The second is on the role of the chief executive in determining the effectiveness of his or her board of directors and in engaging board members in meaningful governance as well as their respective roles and responsibilities. It will be our goal to build upon the voluntary leadership and life experiences of each individual class member and to explore ways in which students can increase their own leadership competencies during the course and then throughout their careers.\n\nThe course will cover the changing roles of arts and cultural organizations in today's world, the funding environments affecting arts nonprofit governance, review basic roles and responsibilities of the chief executive in relation to the board as well as the roles and responsibilities of arts board membership. Particular attention will be paid to board dynamics, especially those between the board as a whole, the board's key leadership and the nonprofit's executive leadership and how our own life and leadership experiences affect our ability to work in concert with others in voluntary capacities.

Students assess their individual learning goals for a practicum experience, gain an understanding of what makes a successful practicum, and draft a practicum proposal. The proposal must identify a practicum field supervisor or mentor with whom the student will work during Part II. The plan must be completed and approved before permission will be granted to register for the second part, ACL 6204.\n\nStudents will then complete the practicum experience while registered for ACL 6204 (Part II) under the direction of an external field supervisor and in conjunction with the university instructor.
