France has a complex relationship with Jews since the Middle Ages. During the French Revolution (1789), then under the Empire (Napoleon Bonaparte, 1800-1815), the Jews benefitted from political emancipation. The Republic defended the equality of Jews before the law as French citizens. But France was also the country of political anti-Semitism and of the Dreyfus Affair (there were in the nineteenth century some very virulent anti-Semitic propaganda writers, for example Edouard Drumont, author of Jewish France, in 1880, just before the Dreyfus Affair). This history of the Jews in France culminates with the Vichy regime, the policy of collaboration with Nazi Germany, antisemitic writings and propaganda emanating from important writers such as Louis-Ferdinand Celine and politicians, and the deportation of part of the Jewish population to the extermination camps. How does this story affect fictional writing, and debates on how to represent this event? More than a course on the Holocaust, we explore the story of its reminiscence in French culture. It is not a history class, but a class in culture, literature, memory and testimony. \n\nprereq: FREN 3015; it is recommended that students have taken, or take concurrently, FREN 3101W.",

How did it define the self?\n\nIn this course, we will study troubadour songs, short tales, romances, and letters composed in twelfth-century France and Anglo-Norman England. We will examine their historical context: the patronage of Eleanor of Aquitaine and her family, the broader context of medieval court life, and the erudite circles that formed during the rise of the Parisian schools. Because what people say is determined by the language, motifs, and forms that they have available to them, we will discuss the transmission of ideas about love and the interpretation of exemplary figures (Tristan and Iseut, Lancelot and Guinevere). We will also consider the literary form of these texts in relation to their meaning. But at the heart of our inquiry will be the notion of the self. How did \"speaking of love\" allow medieval writers to cultivate their own subjectivity or individuality?\n\nTexts will include troubadour songs, the Lais of Marie de France, the romances of Tristan and Iseut by Thomas of England and Béroul, Chrétien de Troyes's Arthurian romances, and the letters of Abelard and Heloise. We will also study a film about Eleanor of Aquitaine and her family (The Lion in Winter, 1968) and a contemporary opera about a troubadour and his lady, Kaija Saariaho's L'Amour de loin (2000). \n\nFREN 3611 and 3711 meet together.

We will examine their historical context: the patronage of Eleanor of Aquitaine and her family, the broader context of medieval court life, and the erudite circles that formed during the rise of the Parisian schools. Because what people say is determined by the language, motifs, and forms that they have available to them, we will discuss the transmission of ideas about love and the interpretation of exemplary figures (Tristan and Iseut, Lancelot and Guinevere). We will also consider the literary form of these texts in relation to their meaning. But at the heart of our inquiry will be the notion of the self. How did \"speaking of love\" allow medieval writers to cultivate their own subjectivity or individuality?\n\nTexts will include troubadour songs, the Lais of Marie de France, the romances of Tristan and Iseut by Thomas of England and Béroul, Chrétien de Troyes's Arthurian romances, and the letters of Abelard and Heloise. We will also study a film about Eleanor of Aquitaine and her family (The Lion in Winter, 1968) and a contemporary opera about a troubadour and his lady, Kaija Saariaho's L'Amour de loin (2000). \n\nFREN 3611 and 3711 meet together.

France has a complex relationship with Jews since the Middle Ages. During the French Revolution (1789), then under the Empire (Napoleon Bonaparte, 1800-1815), the Jews benefitted from political emancipation. The Republic defended the equality of Jews before the law as French citizens. But France was also the country of political anti-Semitism and of the Dreyfus Affair (there were in the nineteenth century some very virulent anti-Semitic propaganda writers, for example Edouard Drumont, author of Jewish France, in 1880, just before the Dreyfus Affair). This history of the Jews in France culminates with the Vichy regime, the policy of collaboration with Nazi Germany, antisemitic writings and propaganda emanating from important writers such as Louis-Ferdinand Celine and politicians, and the deportation of part of the Jewish population to the extermination camps. How does this story affect fictional writing, and debates on how to represent this event? More than a course on the Holocaust, we explore the story of its reminiscence in French culture.
