This question, central to the discipline of anthropology, has provided inspiration to scientists, philosophers, and artists for many centuries. In this course, we will begin to answer this question using the scientific study of the biological and cultural evolution of the human lineage. The first half of the term will introduce you to basic concepts in evolutionary theory: natural selection, genetics, behavioral ecology, and comparative anatomy. Using these tools, we will then spend the rest of the semester reconstructing the ecology, diet, anatomy, and behavior of our early ancestors, from the first apes to walk on two legs to the modern humans that conquered the globe. Weekly readings and lectures will provide the theoretical framework for understanding the evolutionary biology of Homo sapiens; laboratory sections will give you an opportunity to apply these theories and evaluate the fossil evidence for yourself. Through this combined approach, we will tackle such important questions as: What features define the human lineage? In what ecological setting did our ancestors become bipedal? What role did global climate change play in our evolution? How did tool use and cultural evolution feedback into our biological evolution? When and where did modern humans originate and what behaviors characterized this emergence? Why were there many species of humans in the past but only one today? Why is it important for the future of humanity for the average citizen to understand the principles of evolution as applied to the human animal? Upon completion of this course, you will have a broad knowledge of the role biological anthropology plays within the discipline of anthropology. More importantly, however, you will acquire a better understanding of the biological heritage of our species and our place among other forms of life on our planet.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":{"course":[]}},{"code":"ANTH 1001H","subject":"ANTH","id":"1001H","title":"Honors: Human Evolution","info":"From ancestors of chimpanzees/humans to origins of modern humans.

Physicists tell us that time is relative, that it is not a thing or a happening, that it may simply be our name for a structure we cannot comprehend. Meanwhile, in the historical time of Earth, different cultural traditions have experienced, explained, and used time in radically different ways.

Second, we will consider the cultural politics surrounding the music as we focus on question of how historical narratives, popular media and popular perceptions, and scholarly works represent and interpret (in often problematic ways) certain genres of popular music and what the politics of those representations might be; and we will consider also how we listen to “roots music,” how our listening is shaped by contemporary social and political circumstances. Third, we will attempt to understand musical genres in relation to the production of race and class and the experience of racial and class inequalities in the United States, and this may in turn prompt us to think critically about the idea of musical genre itself.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":{"course":[]}},{"code":"ANTH 3035","subject":"ANTH","id":"3035","title":"Anthropologies of Death","info":"Anthropological perspectives on death.

It also examines the interplay between  food security, indigenous knowledge, and environmental sustainability by comparing various  standpoints on African food production, scrutinizing the challenges the continent is facing and the unique perspectives it offers in terms of agricultural development in the globalized world.

On one hand, widely dispersed populations tend to differentiate through the process of adaptation to local environments and the accumulation of random genetic changes. On the other hand, complex patterns of gene exchange and culturally-mitigated migration can overwrite endemic variation, keeping our species genetically integrated and leaving traces of the prehistoric spread of populations around the world. Here, we will explore what it means to be human by examining the diversity of biological adaptations within our species. What features are unique to certain populations? What features unite us as a species? We will also work through the complex issues related to concepts of human race and discuss the biological underpinnings of human variation.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":{"course":[]}},{"code":"ANTH 3143","subject":"ANTH","id":"3143","title":"American Indian Lang/Cult","info":"Survey of cultural developments among native peoples of North American from historic times to present.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":{"course":[]}},{"code":"ANTH 3145W","subject":"ANTH","id":"3145W","title":"Urban Anthropology","info":"This class explores anthropological approaches to urban life.

The practice of warfare brings together a number of unusual\ncharacteristics of our species, including the ability to cooperate, to discuss plans, and to make\nand use weapons, which together combine to create immense human suffering. War has long\nbeen a central topic of anthropologists, who have raised many questions. Is warfare a human\nuniversal? Are there truly peaceful societies? Why does war occur more often at some times and\nplaces than others? How, when and why did warfare evolve? What, if anything, does warfare\nhave to do with intergroup aggression in other animals? What role has warfare, or its more\nprimitive antecedents, played in the evolution of our species?

It places particular emphasis on theories that define human relationships to the environment as recursive and interdependent. These theories stand in contrast to common Western theological suppositions that see the environment as a framework to which human societies adapt or a set of resources for human communities to exploit. Rather, historical ecologists argue that the environment is a true ecology with humans in it. They contend that human communities are fundamentally and inextricably intertwined with the life cycles and needs of other species, and consequently they study how human-environmental interactions emerge through distinct historical processes and cultural circumstances.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":{"course":[]}},{"code":"ANTH 4071","subject":"ANTH","id":"4071","title":"Race, Culture and Vision","info":"Evaluation of main trends in study of racism.

Our aim is to move beyond either a simplistic ethnic pluralism or the superficial “melting pot” progressive history and instead grapple with the materiality of settler colonialism, white supremacy, and capitalism. In learning about this field, we will consider what has distinguished historical archaeology from American archaeology more broadly, and how those differences are parlayed into specific research strengths. This includes several themes: colonialism; the modern world and globalizing economies; intersectional identities (race and ethnicity, class, sex and gender, religion, age, ability/disability) and social movements; public memory and commemoration; landscapes and social space; citizenship and subjectivity. Although historical archaeology until recently has been restrictively defined as addressing the European-colonized New World, the discipline in the past twenty years has significantly broadened its scope and impact on the practice of archaeology as a whole. Throughout the course we will discuss these developments, and what directions archaeology may take in the future as a result.
