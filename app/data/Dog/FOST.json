    "info": "this course examines the historical significance of popular music in the united states from the mid twentieth century to the present.\n\nethnomusicologist alan lomax stated, “as we live, so do we sing.” those words have never been more applicable to the plight of the african american who came to america as slaves. we will examine a variety of musical genres beginning with the music of west africa and moving to plantations songs (spirituals, work songs), and a variety of musical genres ranging from the blues, rhythm and blues, country, folk, soul, rock, disco, and hip-hop. as we examine the various genres we will need to identify some of the individuals who were instrumental in shaping the landscape of what became american popular music. such figures as woody guthrie, bessie smith, duke ellington, buddy holly, robert johnson, ma rainey, elvis presley, stevie wonder, james brown, bob dylan, joan baez, peter, paul and mary, bruce springsteen, lauryn hill, tracy chapman, and jay-z and many others. all of these individuals helped to shape and define the american popular music scene. all of the musical innovations and opportunities experienced by them are tempered by social, political, economic, and religious variables.\n\nas we progress through each era, we will examine many of the social, economic, religious, political, and technological variables that influenced the direction of the music. for example, jim crow laws, the church, the civil rights movements, the student, the anti-war movement, the environment protection and the women’s liberation movements, (anti)-globalization, all played a major role in how the music was influenced. this course will also consider the global impact american pop music has had on the direction and influences of various musical styles and the economic force it has had on the global economy. the diversity dimensions for this course will be race, religion, and gender. this will be the reoccurring theme throughout the semester as we examine the various developments and contributions of african americans.",

    "info": "this course is designed to provide students with an opportunity to learn about the virtual international work environment by critically examining a professional, remote experience abroad through an intercultural lens. a key element to this course is to deepen students’ knowledge of their internship placement country’s professional norms and cultural context in comparison to other students’ internship placement countries, as well as the united states, and understand how covid-19 has impacted these environments. students’ research and writing on covid-19 globally will include ethical analysis on how the national approach has impacted society, if they agree with this approach or not, and why. we will interrogate how this knowledge will influence their behavior in their society and the world. students will also enhance their understanding of their chosen field using a global mindset.\n\nthe course is designed to guide students in the internship experience and create a foundation for a successful professional career as well as working to understand and articulate career skill outcomes. in addition to gaining a cross-cultural comparative view on work, the topics and assignments will deepen students’ insights about themselves, professional expectations, and being successful in the virtual workplace. students are expected to make a valuable contribution to the virtual internship placement through the completion of projects and tasks guided by their internship supervisor in the placement country. this will require students to employ intercultural communication skills in a professional, virtual setting while critically examining their own worldview.\n\nthree credit course\nstudents who take the virtual international internship a second time will complete the three-credit version of this course and will be expected to complete the same number of hours at their internship sites as those who are taking the four-credit course. the academic work for the three-credit course will correspond to the second semester of internship participation in order to increase students’ remote, professional experience, strengthen their knowledge of their chosen industry, as well as enhance their global mind-set. the global perspectives liberal education requirement is not fulfilled by taking the three-credit version of this course.",
