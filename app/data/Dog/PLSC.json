    "title": "Norman Borlaug",
    "info": "In this course, students will examine the life and accomplishments of one of CFANS most notable and impactful alumni, Dr. Norman Borlaug, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970. He is credited with saving more than one billion people from starvation through the development of semi-dwarf, stem rust resistant wheat varieties as part of what became known as the Green Revolution. He later was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the Congressional Gold Medal, making him one of only five people to receive all these awards, the others being Martin Luther King, Jr., Nelson Mandela, Elie Wiesel, and Mother Teresa. In addition to learning about his extraordinary accomplishments in his fields of science, namely plant breeding and plant pathology, students will learn of his many struggles and the perseverance required to achieve his vision of food security. You will explore the roles of the fields of agronomy, plant breeding, plant pathology, agricultural economics, food policy, and politics in achieving Dr. Borlaug’s vision and the role of these disciplines in feeding the world today. In addition, you’ll have the opportunity to interact with individuals from around the world who have been inspired by his work and continue his efforts through their own research and discovery.",
