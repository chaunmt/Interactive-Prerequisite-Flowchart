    "info": "the great inversion, or what former minneapolis mayor rt rybak called “the flight to the city,” has been ongoing for two decades, and to preserve and enhance the quality of life in our cities, we must continue to invest in our urban public realm.  cities must maintain and improve older parks, plazas and streets, but they must also provide new public spaces in developing areas that never had them before - waterfronts, industrial sites, rail yards, and acres of surface parking.  perhaps most important yet easily overlooked is the re-envisioning of the public right-of-way – the street – as a place that accommodates not just cars but multiple transportation modes including buses, rail, bicycles, and scooters and other forms of personal transport, all integrated into an accessible, pedestrian-friendly, safe, and green environment.  the greening of city streets is critical for the creation of lush and livable places while also producing social, economic, and environmental benefits.\n\nsince the start of the covid 19 pandemic in march 2020, our collective experience of the urban public realm and its meaning and value to us have changed dramatically.  our use of public places has increased as parkways once dominated by cars were closed off and filled with pedestrians, cyclists, skateboarders, roller skaters, roller skiers, and people on all other sorts of wheeled conveyances.  park spaces that were once often largely empty filled with people getting exercise, enjoying nature, visiting playgrounds, meeting friends, social-distance dating, taking walking happy hours, having picnics, playing spike ball, hula-hooping, and in the case of the homeless, camping out to avoid the dangers of shelters, to socially distance themselves, and in some cases, both.  following the may 2020 death of george floyd in police custody, our experience of the public realm changed again to include protests, marches, riots, property damage, the creation of new public art, the erection of new monuments, and the removal of old ones.  since march 2020, we have been learning to use our public places many new ways, some traditional, some adaptive, and some temporary.  and the economic effects of the coronavirus – the recession, job losses, reduced spending, and a decline in business – mean that cities and other governments will likely have less tax revenue and therefore less money to invest in the public realm in the coming years.  this will mean not only fewer projects for new or revitalized public places, but also less money for maintenance, operations, and programming of existing places.  it is possible that our public realm will become a little worn in the coming years.\n\nnow more than ever, the work of improving our public realm requires a commitment to multi-disciplinary collaboration and broad and genuine stakeholder engagement processes at an entirely new level.  complicated public realm projects require a form of project team leadership that looks more like representative democracy than the imposition of a wonderfully pure vision by a single brilliant designer.  facilitating this process successfully requires uniquely skilled and open-minded planners and designers who can help us all envision a better way to live together in our cities.  last but not least, 2020 has shown us that social investment and planning for equity and justice in the public realm is as important, if not more important, than capital investment in the actual physical infrastructure.\n\nthe purpose of this course is to help planners, designers, and other city builders come to understand the opportunities and challenges of project implementation through the lens of a specific project type:  the urban public realm project.  the course integrates theory and practice into a framework for understanding the experience of public places and the role of planning and design in the implementation of urban public realm projects – from inception through construction, start-up, and ongoing operations.",

    "info": "the variety of approaches to social welfare policies around the globe – from pensions to poverty relief to parental leave – offer many lessons not only for how to address basic needs, but also for building more gender- and race- equitable societies. this course provides conceptual and historical grounding for understanding the origins and impacts of social welfare policies, and how these policies serve as crucial arbiters of gender, race and class relations. the course compares historical and contemporary social policy regimes and their impacts on individuals and societies in europe and the americas. the course centers on four questions: 1) how are social policies “gendered”, “raced” and “classed”?  the course readings and discussions consider multiple feminist perspectives and approaches which show how social policies are based on specific assumptions about gender and its intersections with race, class, and immigrant status, and in turn create or reinforce a particular social order. 2) why do social policies in different countries look so different? the course traces the historical development of specific social welfare regimes with attention to interactions between states, political parties, unions, firms, and social movements. understanding the historical political determinants of current policies can provide clues to appropriate strategies for change. 3) what lessons can we glean from other countries to promote equity across gender and other forms of inequality? the course dives into research that measures the impact of specific social policies on equity and considers the appropriateness and transferability of policy ideas across borders. 4) what are the contemporary challenges to social welfare systems and their ability to promote gender equity? the course considers a variety of such challenges such as stagnating birth rates that threaten the economic solvency of social policy systems; the pressures of refugees and mass migration; and how the global covid-19 pandemic both revealed and exacerbated underlying deficiencies in social policy systems.",
