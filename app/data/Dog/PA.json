One of the key insights from stratification economics is that conventional policy mechanisms (e.g. deterrence policies in the criminal justice system) don’t work because they fail to take account of the legacy of inequality (e.g. convict lease systems and vagrancy laws). The arguments in favor of reparations, baby bonds, universal health care can be viewed and examined using the methods and techniques of stratification economics. This course introduces students to some new methodologies that complement their training in conventional economic analysis.",

The colonization of the Americas coincided with the fabrication of racial identities that set the terms for membership in what became a white supremacist/racial state wherein all things, including spatial thinking and design, conformed to a racial calculus. As Lipsitz (2007: 12) tells us, “The lived experience of race has a spatial dimension, and the lived experience of space has a racial dimension.” The core of this class will, however, focus on later developments characteristic of the period of rapid urbanization from the Jim Crow era through the New Deal and Civil Rights periods to today. The first section of the course will focus on frameworks for understanding white supremacy generally, and as it relates to urban development specifically.  The second section considers specific domains of urban policy and planning using white supremacy as the analytic framework. In these weeks we examine how white supremacy has been expressed across a range of urban development issue areas, including housing, transportation, the urban environment, education, criminal justice, and urban design, and how policies and planning practice have maintained or disrupted systems of white supremacy.",

    "info": "The Great Inversion, or what former Minneapolis Mayor RT Rybak called “the flight to the city,” has been ongoing for two decades, and to preserve and enhance the quality of life in our cities, we must continue to invest in our urban public realm.  Cities must maintain and improve older parks, plazas and streets, but they must also provide new public spaces in developing areas that never had them before - waterfronts, industrial sites, rail yards, and acres of surface parking.  Perhaps most important yet easily overlooked is the re-envisioning of the public right-of-way – the street – as a place that accommodates not just cars but multiple transportation modes including buses, rail, bicycles, and scooters and other forms of personal transport, all integrated into an accessible, pedestrian-friendly, safe, and green environment.  The greening of city streets is critical for the creation of lush and livable places while also producing social, economic, and environmental benefits.",
    "prereqInfo": "Since the start of the Covid 19 pandemic in March 2020, our collective experience of the urban public realm and its meaning and value to us have changed dramatically.  Our use of public places has increased as parkways once dominated by cars were closed off and filled with pedestrians, cyclists, skateboarders, roller skaters, roller skiers, and people on all other sorts of wheeled conveyances.  Park spaces that were once often largely empty filled with people getting exercise, enjoying nature, visiting playgrounds, meeting friends, social-distance dating, taking walking happy hours, having picnics, playing spike ball, hula-hooping, and in the case of the homeless, camping out to avoid the dangers of shelters, to socially distance themselves, and in some cases, both.  Following the May 2020 death of George Floyd in police custody, our experience of the public realm changed again to include protests, marches, riots, property damage, the creation of new public art, the erection of new monuments, and the removal of old ones.  Since March 2020, we have been learning to use our public places many new ways, some traditional, some adaptive, and some temporary.  And the economic effects of the Coronavirus – the recession, job losses, reduced spending, and a decline in business – mean that cities and other governments will likely have less tax revenue and therefore less money to invest in the public realm in the coming years.  This will mean not only fewer projects for new or revitalized public places, but also less money for maintenance, operations, and programming of existing places.  It is possible that our public realm will become a little worn in the coming years.",

COVID-19 has laid bare the ethnic, racial, class, and gender inequalities in the ways societies across the globe lead material life (economy). Current social and environmental challenges are global and local in scale and challenge us to consider poverty alleviation not as an international issue and only of concern for low resourced communities and developing countries, but one in need of attention in every country in the world, including peoples in the wealthy West.  This course examines the emerging pluriverse paradigm and some of the models intending to transform development: nature rights movement, community economy, solidarity movement, degrowth, transition design, and ontologies and epistemologies of First Nations in North and South America. We will contrast these development models to sustainable development goals and the green growth approach.",

This course provides conceptual and historical grounding for understanding the origins and impacts of social welfare policies, and how these policies serve as crucial arbiters of gender, race and class relations. The course compares historical and contemporary social policy regimes and their impacts on individuals and societies in Europe and the Americas. The course centers on four questions: 1) How are social policies “gendered”, “raced” and “classed”?  The course readings and discussions consider multiple feminist perspectives and approaches which show how social policies are based on specific assumptions about gender and its intersections with race, class, and immigrant status, and in turn create or reinforce a particular social order. 2) Why do social policies in different countries look so different? The course traces the historical development of specific social welfare regimes with attention to interactions between states, political parties, unions, firms, and social movements. Understanding the historical political determinants of current policies can provide clues to appropriate strategies for change. 3) What lessons can we glean from other countries to promote equity across gender and other forms of inequality? The course dives into research that measures the impact of specific social policies on equity and considers the appropriateness and transferability of policy ideas across borders. 4) What are the contemporary challenges to social welfare systems and their ability to promote gender equity? The course considers a variety of such challenges such as stagnating birth rates that threaten the economic solvency of social policy systems; the pressures of refugees and mass migration; and how the global COVID-19 pandemic both revealed and exacerbated underlying deficiencies in social policy systems.",

Each team will be mentored by a retired diplomat, military officer ,or other experienced volunteer who will provide negotiating and strategic advice. A team from the Army War College, a leading institution in strategic exercises, will lead the exercise, providing structured input that gives students a realistic sense of how strategic actors must think and behave in crisis negotiation scenarios. Students are given course material in advance and meet with mentors to prepare for the exercise.

Participants will engage with elected tribal leaders and with the Tribal-State Relations Training program delivered to state employees through a partnership between the Minnesota Indian Affairs Council, MnDOT, and the University of Minnesota Duluth Tribal Sovereignty Institute. Students will consider how their own civic and professional trajectories may connect to Indian nations, and collaboratively draw conceptual and practical links between tribal affairs and other areas of study.",

    "info": "The variety of approaches to social welfare policies around the globe – from pensions to poverty relief to parental leave – offer many lessons not only for how to address basic needs, but also for building more gender- and race- equitable societies. This course provides conceptual and historical grounding for understanding the origins and impacts of social welfare policies, and how these policies serve as crucial arbiters of gender, race and class relations. The course compares historical and contemporary social policy regimes and their impacts on individuals and societies in Europe and the Americas. The course centers on four questions: 1) How are social policies “gendered”, “raced” and “classed”?  The course readings and discussions consider multiple feminist perspectives and approaches which show how social policies are based on specific assumptions about gender and its intersections with race, class, and immigrant status, and in turn create or reinforce a particular social order. 2) Why do social policies in different countries look so different? The course traces the historical development of specific social welfare regimes with attention to interactions between states, political parties, unions, firms, and social movements. Understanding the historical political determinants of current policies can provide clues to appropriate strategies for change. 3) What lessons can we glean from other countries to promote equity across gender and other forms of inequality? The course dives into research that measures the impact of specific social policies on equity and considers the appropriateness and transferability of policy ideas across borders. 4) What are the contemporary challenges to social welfare systems and their ability to promote gender equity? The course considers a variety of such challenges such as stagnating birth rates that threaten the economic solvency of social policy systems; the pressures of refugees and mass migration; and how the global COVID-19 pandemic both revealed and exacerbated underlying deficiencies in social policy systems.",
