Antibiotic resistance currently represents a significant threat to treatment of some infectious bacteria, yet profit incentives and patenting regulations have limited investments by pharmaceutical companies in development of new antimicrobials. This course will explore the intriguing biology, chemistry, ecology, and evolutionary biology of antimicrobial warfare; the history of antibiotic discovery; the broad uses for antibiotics in medicine and agriculture; the costs, profits, and patenting issues associated with antibiotic development and production; the ethics of antibiotic regulation in developed and developing countries; and the future of antibiotic therapies in medicine and agriculture.\n\nprereq: freshman",

Several aspects of agricultural sustainability are important to achieve increased food production, including; maintaining soil fertility, managing water, and plant genetic resources, reducing the environmental impact of agriculture, and restoring\ndegraded lands. To keep up with the growing food demand, there has been an increased use of fertilizers and pesticides in agriculture; however, these chemicals when used in large quantities harm the environment and limit the beneficial activities of plant-associated microbes. Millions of microorganisms live in soil and plants, and many of them have been shown to increase plant biomass without supplementary fertilizers or\nthe use of pesticides to provide protection against plant pathogens. This course is designed for graduate and advanced undergraduate students interested in learning about beneficial soil microbes, how to identify such microbes, and how these microbes can be harnessed to improve the sustainability of our agricultural production systems.\n\nprereq: Basic microbiology is required: BIOL 1961 or PLPA1005.
