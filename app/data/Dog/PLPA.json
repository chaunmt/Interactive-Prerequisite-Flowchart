antibiotic resistance currently represents a significant threat to treatment of some infectious bacteria, yet profit incentives and patenting regulations have limited investments by pharmaceutical companies in development of new antimicrobials. this course will explore the intriguing biology, chemistry, ecology, and evolutionary biology of antimicrobial warfare; the history of antibiotic
