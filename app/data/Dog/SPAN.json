For the Catalan author Blai Bonet, a tuberculosis ward becomes a place to explore the origins of community; for Gabriel García Márquez, the melancholy of inaccessible love drains the body of vitality like cholera; for the Portuguese writer José Saramago, an outbreak of an invented disease causing blindness allows for an exploration of human nature and the 20th-century’s worst excesses of violence, to name three examples studied in the course.\n\nThis Freshman Seminar will explore the literary treatment of infectious disease across a broad spectrum of geographical and temporal signposts.

In SPAN 3015W, students will use their Spanish skills to analyze an assortment of authentic texts (literature, films, essays, podcasts, etc.), to talk with each other and native speakers, and to share their own experiences and ideas in writing. Students use their Spanish to delve into the history, cultures, and diversity of the Spanish-speaking world. As they do this, they revisit and refine specific structures known to pose a challenge to learners of Spanish. \n\nThe first in a series of writing-intensive courses in the major and minor programs, Spanish 3015W focuses upon the acquisition of composition skills with an emphasis on the thesis-fronted, expository writing strategies (i.e. statistical report, literary interpretation, academic essay, etc.) essential for success in more advanced coursework in Spanish Studies. 3015W moves in the direction of a more advanced-level discourse by providing crucial critical and analytical writing experiences to students through the careful scrutiny of authentic Hispanic texts, the composition of three original essays, and the production of a writing portfolio prefaced by a self-evaluative essay (autorreflexión). Regular engagement with reading primary sources and writing about these materials is fundamental to the development of the writer's critical “voice” and the attainment of a style and vocabulary usage appropriate to writing analytically about literary and other key sociocultural issues of the Hispanic world.

How does language work in the human brain? What does it mean to be bilingual Where did Spanish come from? How did it expand across the globe? Why are some aspects of Spanish hard for English speakers to learn? How do we use language to express our identities, and how can language influence how those identities are received and perceived?

    "info": "The term “Siglo de Oro” has been used historically in Spanish to describe the epoch of Spain’s imperial expansion in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Beginning in 1492, the Catholic Monarchs, Isabel, and Fernando consolidated Spanish power over the other kingdoms in Iberia, expelled the Jews, and began the conquest of the so-called “New World.” The following years saw an influx and their kingdom became globally influential, eventually becoming a world empire. But, for whom was this a “Golden Age”? In this class we will explore the historical, political, and social trends that shaped what it meant to be “Spanish” and the territory thought of as “Spain.” The definition of “Spanish” was created in apposition to various Others—the various people and groups that were relegated to the lower echelons of the social hierarchy. Religion played an important role in the shaping of this identity.\n\nWe will apply contemporary theories—such as those around forms of racism, classism, Othering—from the field of cultural studies to cultural and historical developments within the Spanish Golden Age. For example, being “Spanish” was based in the idea of “Cristianos viejos”/Old Christians (who had no trace of Muslim or Christian blood in their family lines). We will explore other peoples and groups in Spain/Iberia and their contributions to what would become the Spanish nation. Among the themes studied in class:\n\n—rhetoric of difference, including the limpieza de sangre or notions of blood purity\n—gender: what did it mean to be española?\n—the Spanish colonies in the Americas and the people who lived there\n—systems of power: Old Christians, nobility and conquerors\n—the institutionalization of “Spain”\n—the subversive concept of the Baroque: Miguel de Cervantes against the “State”\n\nprereq: A grade of C- or better in SPAN 3104W or SPAN 3104V or TLDO 3104W or ARGN 3104W or SPAN 3105W or SPAN 3105V or TLDO 3105W or SPAN 3107W or SPAN 3107V or TLDO 3107W",

The course examines the role of colonial discourse as producer of the epistemic colonial difference and explores the legacies of colonialism. Students will be expected to focus on and to think about the organizational mechanisms through which aural and visual practices mediate reality in Colonial Latin America. Furthermore, students will learn to be critical readers by considering how cultural texts may be historically determined and by exploring how individuals may shape a particular cultural theme in a variety of manners. The course will focus on critical readings and discussion of cultural artifacts, literary texts, and documents of Colonial Latin America. Studies will include material pertaining to the aural and visual production of the period, including European and indigenous accounts of the conquest, as well as indigenous, African, criollo, mestizo and women writings during the colony from an interdisciplinary perspective. Concentration will center on the textual strategies, topics, world views, motivations, projects, and expectations explicit or implicit in the texts, their significance at the time, and their importance for understanding the formation of what we know as Latin America today. The course also is devoted to the conquest of Latin America by analyzing the role of colonial discourse and the legacies of colonialism in the region. With cultural artifacts, texts and documents, students will deal with different theoretical approaches deriving from the humanities and the social sciences. Such interdisciplinary method will provide the tools, concepts, and strategic visions to carry on analytical tasks in class. All the work for the course, except for certain supplementary readings, will be in Spanish. Requirements will include preparation of assigned readings, presentation of analytical and comprehensive tasks, class discussions, and a research project.

Our readings will primarily  focus on how the humanities and the arts engage in discussions of the impact that environmental issues and the ecological crisis have on health, illness, and sanitary crisis. Through a collection of Latin American novels, short stories, essays, and films, we will explore the intricate  connections between the human and the non-human, the impacts of environmental changes on individual and community health and well-being, and the exacerbation of social inequalities and violations of human and environmental rights in Latin America. Additionally, we will emphasize the struggles for resistance and transformation, acknowledging the interconnectedness of all forms of life. With a particular emphasis on the interplay between health and social and  environmental justice, we will investigate how literature, documentary film, and art can contribute to these discussions and what we can learn from Latin American thinkers, writers, artists, and social activists. We will explore essential concepts and debates and analyze portrayals of illness, toxicity, degradation, extractivism, as well as various expressions of healing, communities of care, and the struggles and initiatives to interconnect medical and environmental humanities. We will also  explore the role that literature, art, and film currently play (or potentially play) in the education  of health professionals. ",

    "title": "History of Spanish &Portuguese",
    "info": "This course constitutes an introduction to the origins and history of the Spanish language. Spanish (or Castilian) descends from Latin, which is also the ancestor of Portuguese, Italian, French, Romanian, among others. This is why we say bueno in Spanish, bon in French, buono in Italian, bom in Portuguese, and buna in Romanian. Also, Latin belongs to a wider group of languages: the Indo-European family, which also includes Sanskrit, English, German, and Russian, among others. For this reason, the word for the number two in English is similar to dos in Spanish, dvaú in Sanscript, dva in Russian and zwei in German. \n\nIn the course, we will see how Latin words changed to become Spanish words. These changes did not happen in a void. Therefore, in the first part of the course we will study the historical circumstances that caused the birth and expansion of Spanish. When Romans invaded the Iberian Peninsula there were other groups already there who lent some of their words to Latin. Celts occupied the northwestern portion of Spain, which is known as Galicia. Interestingly, the traditional musical instrument of Galicia is the bagpipe, as in Ireland and Scotland, which also have Celtic ancestors. Some Celtic words passed to the variety of Latin spoken in the Iberian Peninsula, and later to Spanish. Thus, while France and Italy utilize the Germanic word bier to designate beer: French bière, Italian birra, in Spanish we say cerveza, which comes from the Celtic word cerevisia. With the fall of the Roman Empire, Germanic tribes invaded the Iberian Peninsula. This is how some Germanic terms passed to Latin and eventually became Spanish. Since English is a Germanic language, these Spanish terms are similar to the English ones: spy espía, vandalism vandalismo, goose, ganso, etc. At the end of the Germanic rule, Arab groups invaded Iberia. As a result, Spanish has more than four thousand Arabic words, as ojalá from inshallah ‘god willing’. The Arabs brought with them advances in astronomy, mathematics, medicine, agriculture, poetry, etc. For this reason, during the Middle Age, Al-Andalús, which was the name of the territory of the Iberian Peninsula occupied by the Arabs, flourished economically and culturally. It is during this period that Spanish developed. \n\nIn the second part of the course, we will see how Latin words transformed into Spanish. These changes were not at random, on the contrary most of them changed in predictable ways. For example, the Latin letter p when placed between two vowels became b in Spanish: the word lupus ‘wolf’ became lobo in Spanish, scopa ‘broom’ became escoba. Studying this evolution will help you understand the reason behind some supposed irregularities in the Spanish Grammar: duermo vs. dormimos. Also, you will be able to recognize the relation between some English and Spanish words, since both languages are like lone cousins.\n\nprereq: A grade of C- or better in SPAN 3104W or SPAN 3104V or TLDO 3104W or ARGN 3104W or SPAN 3105W or SPAN 3105V or TLDO 3105W or SPAN 3107W or SPAN 3107V or TLDO 3107W.",

Meaning is not simply transmitted from speaker to audience but negotiated by the participants of the communicative interaction. You will learn how Spanish speakers deal with requests, refusals, compliments, advice, and apologies, and how they accommodate their discourse to their interlocutors. You will also explore how courtesy and discourtesy are expressed and inferred by Spanish speakers and how Spanish is utilized to persuade the audience, thus bringing up issues of language and power. Finally, you will study how members of Hispanic culture express themselves by non-verbal means (gestures, body movements, etc.). In sum, you will be exposed to the sociocultural resources native speakers utilize to infer and convey meaning. In class, after learning the theory, you will work in groups analyzing real cases of oral and written communicative exchanges in Spanish. You will also be asked to work in groups to envision how a native Spanish speaker would linguistically act in a hypothetical communicative situation.\n\nprereq:  grade of C- or better in SPAN 3104W or SPAN 3104V or TLDO 3104W or ARGN 3104W or SPAN 3105W or SPAN 3105V or TLDO 3105W or SPAN 3107W or SPAN 3107V or TLDO 3107W",

The first part of this course provides an overview of the main theories and processes of second language acquisition as they apply to Spanish second language learners and heritage speakers of Spanish to answer questions such as: How do individuals acquire a second language? In what ways is the process similar to or different from first language acquisition? In what ways are heritage learners similar to or different from second language learners? What level of proficiency do most Spanish majors attain by the time they graduate? What strategies can language learners use to reach higher levels of proficiency?\n \nThe second part of the course will focus on the aspects of Spanish that are especially challenging for both second language learners and heritage speakers. For example, we’ll analyze why the distinction between the preterite and imperfect past tenses is so difficult for English-speakers to acquire. We’ll also examine pragmatic differences in the way people interact in Spanish and English. For example, is making a request in a restaurant done the same way in Minneapolis as in Madrid, Spain or Quito, Ecuador? How do English speakers learn to make appropriate requests in Spanish? Students will analyze actual native speaker and learner production of Spanish so they can develop a greater awareness of how the language works in context and how it varies across the Spanish-speaking world.\n\nprereq: A grade of C- or better in SPAN 3104W or SPAN 3104V or TLDO 3104W or ARGN 3104W or SPAN 3105W or SPAN 3105V or TLDO 3105W or SPAN 3107W or SPAN 3107V or TLDO 3107W.",

While we will be learning about translation to some extent, the goal of the course is not to turn you into a translator (though it can be a starting point if you have an interest in pursuing additional coursework in translation). Rather, translation will provide an opportunity to think about the factors we need to take into consideration when making the large number of decisions we need to make when using the Spanish language. Throughout the course a variety of types of texts will be examined that vary in terms of style, audience and lexicon, and these will serve as a framework for learning to make decisions that accurately communicate our intended meaning in Spanish. In doing so, we will review many points of Spanish grammar and learn to think about them in new ways – from the most basic grammar points that students think they understand well but perhaps haven’t realized that there are subtle differences from English to those grammar points that always pose challenges for even the most advanced students. If you come with an open mind to think about the Spanish language in a new way you will put yourself in the best position to be successful. \n\nprereq: A grade of C- or better in SPAN 3104W or SPAN 3104V or TLDO 3104W or ARGN 3104W or SPAN 3105W or SPAN 3105V or TLDO 3105W or SPAN 3107W or SPAN 3107V or TLDO 3107W.",
