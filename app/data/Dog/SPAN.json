Spanish (or Castilian) descends from Latin, which is also the ancestor of Portuguese, Italian, French, Romanian, among others. This is why we say bueno in Spanish, bon in French, buono in Italian, bom in Portuguese, and buna in Romanian. Also, Latin belongs to a wider group of languages: the Indo-European family, which also includes Sanskrit, English, German, and Russian, among others. For this reason, the word for the number two in English is similar to dos in Spanish, dvaú in Sanscript, dva in Russian and zwei in German. ","prereqInfo":"In the course, we will see how Latin words changed to become Spanish words. These changes did not happen in a void. Therefore, in the first part of the course we will study the historical circumstances that caused the birth and expansion of Spanish. When Romans invaded the Iberian Peninsula there were other groups already there who lent some of their words to Latin. Celts occupied the northwestern portion of Spain, which is known as Galicia. Interestingly, the traditional musical instrument of Galicia is the bagpipe, as in Ireland and Scotland, which also have Celtic ancestors. Some Celtic words passed to the variety of Latin spoken in the Iberian Peninsula, and later to Spanish. Thus, while France and Italy utilize the Germanic word bier to designate beer: French bière, Italian birra, in Spanish we say cerveza, which comes from the Celtic word cerevisia. With the fall of the Roman Empire, Germanic tribes invaded the Iberian Peninsula. This is how some Germanic terms passed to Latin and eventually became Spanish. Since English is a Germanic language, these Spanish terms are similar to the English ones: spy espía, vandalism vandalismo, goose, ganso, etc. At the end of the Germanic rule, Arab groups invaded Iberia. As a result, Spanish has more than four thousand Arabic words, as ojalá from inshallah ‘god willing’. The Arabs brought with them advances in astronomy, mathematics, medicine, agriculture, poetry, etc. For this reason, during the Middle Age, Al-Andalús, which was the name of the territory of the Iberian Peninsula occupied by the Arabs, flourished economically and culturally. It is during this period that Spanish developed.

In sum, you will be exposed to the sociocultural resources native speakers utilize to infer and convey meaning. In class, after learning the theory, you will work in groups analyzing real cases of oral and written communicative exchanges in Spanish. You will also be asked to work in groups to envision how a native Spanish speaker would linguistically act in a hypothetical communicative situation.","prereqInfo":"prereq:  grade of C- or better in SPAN 3104W or SPAN 3104V or TLDO 3104W or ARGN 3104W or SPAN 3105W or SPAN 3105V or TLDO 3105W or SPAN 3107W or SPAN 3107V or TLDO 3107W","prereq":{"course":[{"code":"SPAN 3104W","subject":"SPAN","id":"3104W"},{"code":"SPAN 3104V","subject":"SPAN","id":"3104V"},{"code":"TLDO 3104W","subject":"TLDO","id":"3104W"},{"code":"ARGN 3104W","subject":"ARGN","id":"3104W"},{"code":"SPAN 3105W","subject":"SPAN","id":"3105W"},{"code":"SPAN 3105V","subject":"SPAN","id":"3105V"},{"code":"TLDO 3105W","subject":"TLDO","id":"3105W"},{"code":"SPAN 3107W","subject":"SPAN","id":"3107W"},{"code":"SPAN 3107V","subject":"SPAN","id":"3107V"},{"code":"TLDO 3107W","subject":"TLDO","id":"3107W"}]}},{"code":"SPAN 3705H","subject":"SPAN","id":"3705H","title":"Honors: Spanish Semantics","info":"Sense relations.

In what ways is the process similar to or different from first language acquisition? In what ways are heritage learners similar to or different from second language learners? What level of proficiency do most Spanish majors attain by the time they graduate? What strategies can language learners use to reach higher levels of proficiency?\n \nThe second part of the course will focus on the aspects of Spanish that are especially challenging for both second language learners and heritage speakers. For example, we’ll analyze why the distinction between the preterite and imperfect past tenses is so difficult for English-speakers to acquire. We’ll also examine pragmatic differences in the way people interact in Spanish and English. For example, is making a request in a restaurant done the same way in Minneapolis as in Madrid, Spain or Quito, Ecuador? How do English speakers learn to make appropriate requests in Spanish? Students will analyze actual native speaker and learner production of Spanish so they can develop a greater awareness of how the language works in context and how it varies across the Spanish-speaking world.","prereqInfo":"prereq: A grade of C- or better in SPAN 3104W or SPAN 3104V or TLDO 3104W or ARGN 3104W or SPAN 3105W or SPAN 3105V or TLDO 3105W or SPAN 3107W or SPAN 3107V or TLDO 3107W.","prereq":{"course":[{"code":"SPAN 3104W","subject":"SPAN","id":"3104W"},{"code":"SPAN 3104V","subject":"SPAN","id":"3104V"},{"code":"TLDO 3104W","subject":"TLDO","id":"3104W"},{"code":"ARGN 3104W","subject":"ARGN","id":"3104W"},{"code":"SPAN 3105W","subject":"SPAN","id":"3105W"},{"code":"SPAN 3105V","subject":"SPAN","id":"3105V"},{"code":"TLDO 3105W","subject":"TLDO","id":"3105W"},{"code":"SPAN 3107W","subject":"SPAN","id":"3107W"},{"code":"SPAN 3107V","subject":"SPAN","id":"3107V"},{"code":"TLDO 3107W","subject":"TLDO","id":"3107W"}]}},{"code":"SPAN 3707","subject":"SPAN","id":"3707","title":"Lngstc Accrcy via Translation","info":"In this class, we will use translation as a tool to improve the accuracy with which we communicate in Spanish.

Rather, translation will provide an opportunity to think about the factors we need to take into consideration when making the large number of decisions we need to make when using the Spanish language. Throughout the course a variety of types of texts will be examined that vary in terms of style, audience and lexicon, and these will serve as a framework for learning to make decisions that accurately communicate our intended meaning in Spanish.
