    "info": "This course provides graduate students  with a knowledge base for understanding virus pathogenesis and host interactions. Topics for the course will focus on the molecular, cellular, and organismal aspects of virus pathogenesis and host interactions. The concepts of cellular pathogenesis, tissue tropism, portals of entry, local replication and virus spread, virus dissemination, and congenital infections will be covered. A particular emphasis will be placed on virus pathogenesis of the major virus families (e.g., arenaviruses, bacteriophages, flaviviruses, herpesviruses, orthomyxoviruses, picornaviruses, and retroviruses) and virus-host cell interactions that can restrict virus replication and are responsible for immunity will be discussed.",

Topics for the course will focus on the biochemical, molecular, cellular, clinical, and epidemiological aspects of emerging viruses, with an emphasis on how each plays a\nrole in virus evolution and emergence. This course will emphasize HIV as a key example of an emerging virus disease that has had a profound impact on human health. MS-level and advanced undergraduate students should register for OBIO 5050.",
