    "info": "Academics and researchers have long used data & visualization to support and illuminate particular narratives in their scholarship. Today, data visualizations are found not only in the pages of academic journals; many non-academics, including journalists and activists, use increasingly complex data visualizations and statistical summaries to convey salient information and storylines. This course will help students build on their statistical thinking and understanding learned in high school to think critically about the use of summaries and visualization and their role in the data narrative. It will also cover the use of computational tools and methods for creating data summaries and visualization that facilitate seeing patterns and relationships in data, and producing better narrative through communicating with data. Students will learn course material through in-class activities and projects conducted in cooperative learning groups and through assignments requiring the application of concepts and technology presented in class to additional real-world examples of data visualization.",

Specifically, through the lenses of education, we review principles of learning, memory, development, intelligence, and interventions; through the lenses of health and wellness, we review personality, biological, social, and cognitive bases of normal and abnormal behavior, as well as treatments; and, through the lenses of business and organizations, we review principles of motivation, sensation perception, and social behavior. Thus, these psychological principles are considered theoretically, empirically, and through examples for application, with lab discussions and projects emphasizing education, business, health and wellness. The course serves as a foundation for future coursework in education, health sciences, and psychology, and is consistent with the APAs public education effort to demonstrate how the science and application of psychology benefits society and improves lives.",

There is sometimes too much research to make sense of it all. As an undergraduate student, you have likely found many examples of research, and it will only become more important in your own academic career, and if you choose to pursue an academic route, in your own development as a scholar. Therefore, learning the basics of research--how it is conducted, how it can be used to answer everyday questions, and what makes it good quality--will make you not only a better researcher, but also a better consumer of academic and popular research.",

    "info": "Field experiences (prior to student teaching) meet the requirements set by Minnesota’s Professional Educator Licensing and Standards Board (PELSB). The focus of this course is for initial licensure teacher candidates in the field of special education in preparation for practicing principles required for successful inclusion of students in their least restrictive environment (LRE). Teacher candidates will observe and interact with students with disabilities (license specific) teachers in ECSE and elementary school settings. Consistent with the mission of the College of Education and Human Development and the Special Education Programs, this field experience strengthens effective educational practices, promotes inquiry and problem solving skills, and builds leadership skills for special educators who work with students with disabilities specific to the licensure area. All placements are requested and confirmed by the Field Placement Coordinator in the Special Education Program. Placements are based on licensure program requirements and information (e.g., availability) teacher candidates provide on the Field Experience Placement Questionnaire. Field experiences occur during the regular school day; scheduled between the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Schedules vary by school and cooperating teacher. You will receive an email with all placement details once finalized.",

The course will build toward an understanding of core features of play, including how rules structure play, how players inhabit roles, and what constitutes playfulness. Students will then apply this play framework critically in reflections on the design of play in learning environments, covering how play differs from games, how power operates within play, how to design for failure in play, and why play is a brittle social activity. The course is meant primarily for graduate students in the Department of Educational Psychology and within the College of Education and Human Development who have an interest in studying the role of play in learning and/or designing learning environments to nurture play. Students in this course will have opportunities to design for play, examine through qualitative methods video data of children playing during learning, and plan for how play might inform their research.",
