    "info": "Since the beginning of time, human beings have been captivated by stories. Stories engage, persuade, and motivate. Storytelling is widely used in business. In marketing, some of the strongest brands leverage their heritage; others have powerful origin or founder stories at their core. Advertisers routinely employ storytelling techniques as a way to attract a customer's attention and keep it. Ireland is a country with a rich storytelling tradition. Irish culture, history, and music abound with myth, lore, and legend. This course is intended to explore the components of effective storytelling and the many methods of storytelling including written, oral, music, film, and digital media to investigate the role of storytelling in business and culture.",

    "info": "In today’s culture of consumption, free choice, and materialism, the pursuit of happiness through the “good life” seems to be an attainable goal. Retail therapy uplifts our spirits. Finding the best deals gives us a sense of accomplishment. Online shopping makes it ever so easy to instantly gratify our desires. Enjoyment through food, travel, and novel experiences is more accessible than ever. A wide variety of entertainment and social connections are available, literally, at the tip of our fingers. Still, we feel empty, wanting, and dissatisfied time and again. We continue to experience boredom, unhappiness, and loneliness. Why this paradox? This question has spurred recent research in consumer behavior, decision making, and psychology. \nIn this seminar, we will explore some of the latest scientific findings as well as selected perspectives from ancient philosophy to help us understand this phenomenon and build a happier and better life. We will tackle questions such as, how can we experience more happiness in our lives? Can we increase the level of enjoyment we experience through our consumption activities? How can we make happiness last longer? What are some effective ways of reducing boredom and dealing with negative emotions? How can we increase our wellbeing through our daily work and activities in college? Most importantly, we will develop a tool kit to help us on our journey to happiness and success. \n",

Those, by and large, do not work. Not only do they not work, but they are also costly and can even make the unwanted behavior emerge even more than before the shove by creating boomerang or counterproductive effects. prereq: MKTG 3001",
