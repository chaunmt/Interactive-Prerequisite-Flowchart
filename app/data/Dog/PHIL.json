greatness and power that every age since has found something in it to value. mozart is also an intriguing figure for other reasons. what we know about his personality seems wildly at odds with the

of our modes of valuing persons by introducing and investigating a class of esteem-based, person-focused evaluative attitudes. paradigms of the class include forms of contempt, shame, pride, and love.

to mean that our core beliefs and assumptions are affected and the relationship with our environment is ruptured; we have fallen out of normalcy. the term existentialism -- turning existential into a noun -- came into being in the 1940s in france, reflecting the collective experience of societal breakdown, of nazism, and ww2. it has since been applied to all modes of philosophical inquiry that take an individual's experience of alienation from society as their point of departure. the advantage of making alienation the focus of this class, too, is that it allows us to recognize the precise historical and sociological index of the emergence of an existentialist mode of thought and practice. existentialism looks very different when it responds to a 19th century crisis of faith (søren kierkegaard), to 1950s colonialism (frantz fanon), to weimar germany's new democracy and the specter of a mass society (martin heidegger), or to the neo-authoritarian french society of the 1960s (simone de beauvoir). existentialism then is understood in this class not as a conversation between great thinkers or ideas across time and space, but as a response to a specific crisis of norms and values. it only exists in plural. if existentialist concepts -- like being-in-the world, being-towards-death, or the gaze of the other -- are carried forward, then not without being repurposed. such situatedness is inherent to existentialism itself. accordingly, existentialist writers have no creed or ethical stance in common; they are found both on the far (fascist) right and on the marxist left. they do share though a keen interest in a new language and in literary forms of expression and subsequently, they insist on the individuals' capacity of \\\"world-making\\\" -- in rupture and rebellion -- against seemingly compromised societal norms.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"PHIL 3010W","subject":"PHIL","id":"3010W","title":"Classical Ancient Text","info":"introduction to

societal conversation. from insurance coverage to the consumer advertising of pharmaceuticals, the variety of issues and their visibility is patently obvious. however, conceptual issues in medicine, such as what counts as health and disease or what do we mean by \\\"evidence-based\\\" or \\\"precision\\\" medicine, are arguably just as important--if not prior to--many of these other issues. for example, if doctors do not consider something an \\\"official\\\" disease or condition, it is unlikely your insurance company will pay to treat it. additional conceptual questions include: what role do theories play in medicine? can scientific experiments be replicated in clinical medicine? should all medicine be based on evidence? how do we know what causes health or disease? what do advances in neuroscience reveal about the relationship between mind and body, especially with respect to mental health and illness? what properties do physicians measure and why? how does probability and chance enter into medical practice (e.g., diagnosis, therapy, and rehabilitation)?\n\nthis course is an introduction to these and other related issues in medicine with an emphasis on their diversity and heterogeneity. it is designed for undergraduates across a variety of majors with an interest in these conceptual questions, including but not limited to animal science; anthropology; biochemistry; biology, society and environment; chemistry; ecology, evolution and behavior; genetics, cell biology and development; microbiology; neuroscience; physiology; psychology). no prior knowledge of medicine or philosophy is required; i do not assume that you have any previous exposure to the material we will be covering.\n\nmost of the assignments for this course are writing oriented. the goal is to identify, characterize, and critically reflect on the issues raised in our discussions and do this in the medium of writing. at the end of the class you will possess new analytical skills and

like martin heidegger, hannah arendt, ayn rand, silvia plath, or franz fanon. this list already makes it a hard to define a creed or an ethical or political commitment that these writers have in common. what then will allow us to call them existentialist? to begin with, it is perhaps the focus on individual experience, on the experience of finitude, a heightened awareness of the individual's embeddedness in a here and now and a quest for the possibility of an unalienated life. such concerns cannot easily be expressed through a systematic philosophy, a set of definitions and principles that can be passed on. instead literary writing became a form of philosophical inquiry. further, how these concerns could lend themselves to the most revolutionary as well as the most conservative, even fascist politics, will be one of the puzzles we will seek to answer in this course. we will engage with a number of canonical existentialist texts and trace what defines existentialism as a key

that we know how to explain our own behavior and that of others -- and all of this without any formal training in the relevant science.  all of this is surely amazing; indeed it verges on the outrageous.  we admit to not knowing the makeup of the simplest structures, to not knowing how to explain the behavior of the simplest organisms -- we, of course, leave such issues to scientific

by citing the relevant beliefs, desires, etc. and, to repeat, we know all of this with no formal training.  strange indeed.  not only is this initial confidence puzzling, but attempts to articulate the mental story and to integrate it into the larger scientific picture have all proven problematical.   \n\nwe start our investigation with a very brief glance at a mid-century proposal that initiated a very different way of thinking about mind: the proposal by turing -- one of the great minds of the 20th century--that machines of a certain kind could exhibit intelligence. a story told in

friedrich nietzsche--and comprising figures like martin heidegger, hannah arendt, ayn rand, silvia plath, or franz fanon. this list already makes it a hard to define a creed or an ethical or political commitment that these writers have in common. what then will allow us to call them existentialist? to begin with, it is perhaps the focus on individual experience, on the experience of finitude, a heightened awareness of the individual's embeddedness in a here and now, and a quest for the possibility of an unalienated life. such concerns cannot easily be expressed through a systematic philosophy, a set of definitions and principles that can be passed on. instead literary writing became a form of philosophical inquiry. further, how these concerns could lend themselves to the most revolutionary as well as the most conservative, even fascist politics, will be one of the puzzles we will seek to answer in this course. we will engage with a number of canonical existentialist texts

broadly. as we will address these works, and the issues and concepts they take up, they fall within the larger field of moral philosophy. like other works in this broad category, discussion in political philosophy typically consider both metaethical and normative questions. \n\nmetaethical questions concern the concepts we use as we consider matters of right and wrong or of ethical value. in the realm of political philosophy, authors consider rightness, wrongness and ethical value as they bear on political societies and political leaders, and not only on citizens but on non-citizens who experience the effects of political power. examples of such questions include: what is justice? what is political power? what are freedom, equality and autonomy?\n\nnormative questions, by contrast, concern matters of practice. in the context of moral and political philosophy, they are typically questions about what we must do or refrain from doing if we are to act rightly (as opposed to prudently or efficiently for instance). examples in the political realm include: what are just standards of criminal punishment? what obligations does a just state have to citizens and to non-citizen residents? what right, if any, do citizens and others have to protest state laws, policies and actions? what rights can citizens or others claim to equality under the law? what grounds or justifies our responses to such questions?\n\nover the course of this semester, we will read both canonical texts in the history of political philosophy and pieces by a variety of authors who are less well known. our aim will be to improve our ability to understand broad claims and more nuanced points, to compare and critically assess contrasting views, and to appreciate the ways in which political philosophers often draw or expand on others' works even as they challenge them. we will also be working towards improvements in the difficult task of explaining and supporting claims and analyses, in short written pieces, longer essays and oral discussions.","prereqInfo":"1004 or instr consent","prereq":{"code":"PHIL 1004","subject":"PHIL","id":"1004"}},{"code":"PHIL

yet \\\"biology\\\" consists of a variety of different disciplinary approaches: from protein biochemistry to field ecology, from developmental biology to evolutionary genetics. many philosophical issues can be found in the concepts and practices of life science researchers from these different disciplines. what is the structure of evolutionary theory? what is a gene? what are the units of selection? what is an individual? what counts as a \\\"cause\\\"? what is the relationship between evolution and development? are all biological phenomena reducible to genes or molecules? what are adaptations, and how do we identify them? what is an ecological niche? is there a progressive trend in the history of life? is there such a thing as 'human nature'? \n\nthis course is an introduction to these and other related issues in the biological sciences with an emphasis on their diversity and heterogeneity. it is designed for advanced undergraduates with an interest in conceptual questions and debates in biology that are manifested across a variety of majors (e.g., animal science; anthropology; biochemistry; biology, society and environment; biosystems and agricultural engineering; chemistry; ecology, evolution and behavior; genetics, cell biology and development; microbiology; neuroscience; physiology; plant biology; psychology). some of these issues will appear familiar from previous coursework or opportunities, whereas new issues will be intriguing because of their similarities and differences with those that have been encountered in other contexts.","prereqInfo":"courses in [philosophy or biology] or instr consent","prereq":[]},{"code":"PHIL 5611","subject":"PHIL","id":"5611","title":"Phil Soc Sciences","info":"criteria for

Machines","info":"mind-body problem. philosophical relevance of cybernetics, artificial intelligence, computer simulation.\n\nmental phenomena present the philosopher with a number of deep but inescapable puzzles and challenges.  we tend to suppose that we know what it is to have a mind, to have beliefs, desires, etc., and we think that we know how to explain our own behavior and that of others -- and all of this without any formal training in the relevant science.  all of this is surely amazing; indeed it verges on the outrageous.  we admit to not knowing the makeup of the simplest structures, to not knowing how to explain the behavior of the simplest organisms -- we, of course, leave such issues to scientific investigation. yet, at the same time, we think we know how to explain the behavior of this most complex of systems; we know how to do it, and we know what we are talking about when we explain behavior by citing the relevant beliefs, desires, etc. and, to repeat, we know all of this with no formal training.  strange indeed.  not only is this initial confidence puzzling, but attempts to articulate the mental story and to integrate it into the larger scientific picture have all proven problematical.   \n\nwe start our investigation with a very brief glance at a mid-century proposal that initiated a very different way of thinking about mind: the proposal by turing -- one of the great minds of the 20th century--that machines of a certain kind could exhibit intelligence. a story told in part in the recent movie, the imitation game. we then turn to some more traditional approaches to mind: cartesianism, behaviorism and materialism.","prereqInfo":"one course in philosophy or instr consent","prereq":[]},{"code":"PHIL
