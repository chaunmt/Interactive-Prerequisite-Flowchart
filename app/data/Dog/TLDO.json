    "info": "bioethics was initially projected with very wide objectives. v.r. potter understood it as a dialogue between scientists and humanists to preserve humanity from its self-destruction and promote quality of life. in his words, “mankind is urgently in need of a new wisdom that will provide the ‘knowledge of how to use knowledge’ for man’s survival and for improvement in the quality of life….i therefore propose the term bioethics in order to emphasize the two most important ingredients in achieving the new wisdom that is so desperately needed: biological knowledge and human values.” the encyclopedia of bioethics, edited by warren reich in 1978, suggests the following definition of bioethics: “systematic study of human conduct in the area of the life sciences and health care, insofar as this conduct is examined in the light of moral, values, and principles.”",
    "prereqInfo": "the complex, multi-disciplinary model of modern healthcare creates numerous ethical conflicts. when the values of all the actors are taken into account when making decisions, there is inevitably disparity of criteria. the conflicts generated are not merely technical; they are also ethical, because the values of the people or institutions involved can be in conflict. in these instances, it is important that the medical professional knows to consider technical issues (the medical facts) and the values at play (the preferences of those involved, principles, norms, etc.), in order to make a good decision. at present, bioethics is considered a practical or applied ethics (to biomedicine), that attempts to resolve ethical dilemmas present in biomedicine. there are various fields within bioethics. the most relevant are foundational bioethics (which deals with the philosophical foundations of bioethics), environmental bioethics, clinical bioethics, and the bioethics of research. bioethical issues tend to be complex problems that extend beyond the limits of a sole profession, for which reason it is essential to consider the input of healthcare professionals, philosophers, lawyers, psychologists, social workers, sociologists, and any other profession involved in the most hot-button ethical issues relating to the life sciences.",
