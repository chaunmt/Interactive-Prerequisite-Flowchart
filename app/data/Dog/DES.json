This course provides a set of experiences that help to explain the concepts of design through the lenses of different fields of design, both traditional and emerging, within the College of Design. Students from various design disciplines will engage in design experiences that teach them how designers from different fields identify, define and solve problems. They will be introduced to the resources offered to designers in the College of Design through hands-on experiences. Students will reflect upon their experiences by\nparticipating in a series of experiences, by submitting a series of reflection pieces, and completing a culminating project that will be shared with class members and invited stakeholders. Through this engagement, students will learn about each other and their motivations for being in the College of Design, as well as gain an understanding of the breadth of the college and its resources as they begin their design education.",

We will engage in the peer review process, to help them function as a collaborative work group and improve presentation. Furthermore, interactions with families and individuals experiencing homelessness and housing providers combined with reflective writing will encourage students to explore biases about poverty and a sense of responsibility to address poverty as a social issue. Finally, based on their interests, discussion, and engagement experiences, students will develop a cogent explanation of homelessness and propose a solution. It is my responsibility to provide a safe and supportive learning environment where students can challenge their assumptions and biases, develop empathy for individuals experiencing homelessness, and learn to develop their own proposal for change that is grounded in solid information and experiences.",

Literature from first wave feminism reveals visceral tensions between fashion and the perceived value of women in society. Fashionable dress was considered constrictive, submissive, and indicative of women’s diminished role in both private and public realms. Second wave feminism, which took place between approximately 1963 and 1975, did not often address fashion directly. However, there were dramatic changes in beauty ideals during this time. Second wave feminism reached mainstream culture through authors such as Simone de Beauvoir, Frances Beal, Betty Friedan, and Gloria Steinem.",

Additionally, the class will look at ways that women from different racial, social, and cultural backgrounds experienced feminism during the late 19th and 20th centuries, as well as today. Readings, videos, and in-class activities will be used to prompt students to reflect on their own practices and self-presentation. Small group discussion will be used frequently to get at deeper meanings behind readings.

This seminar follows a similar contour to discover the acts of countless individuals from around the world and then outline a story, a kind of family tree, of the individual efforts to create the materials and products that converge to make a house. Matthew Barzun in his book The Power of Giving Power Way describes the coming together of diverse interests, talents, and motivations as constellations of stars. Each star bright and unique and its own system. When we gaze into the sky, we can see each individual star. We also see stars together and patterns emerge creating constellations. Each constellation having its own story and stories reflecting a meaning beyond their pattern.  In a similar way using Barzun’s constellation analogy we will also explore and express how the disparate physical objects each with their own story come together in a pattern we call house but also creates an idea of home that has the possibility of becoming meaningful for the people who inhabit it.\nThis seminar will be a combination of readings, research, and critical discussions punctuated with field trips and conversations with fabricators, showroom personnel, and contractors to guide us through the journey. A series of short individual assignments in various digital visual and physical media will converge in the collaborative design of a house and an idea about home created by all the students of the class.
