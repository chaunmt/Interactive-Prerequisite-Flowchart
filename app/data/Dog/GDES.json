    "info": "This design foundations course introduces students to color theory and its application in two and three-dimensional design through lectures, demonstrations, extensive studio work and critiques. Emphasis is placed on attuning the student eye to nuances of color and in developing the ability to use color effectively in two dimensional design applications. This occurs by learning, studying, and practicing the use of traditional design elements, Gestalt grouping principles, theories of color organization, color and spatial\nperception, and color interaction. Work for this course is created using both digital design tools and analog methods.\nBut it is so much more. Intended for (pre) majors in the Department of Design, Housing, and Apparel, this class has a well-earned reputation as \\\"the toughest class you'll ever love.\\\" Course time is spent with slide and lecture presentations, studio work, and group and individual critiques and feedback activities. Upon completion of class, you will have produced a body of work that is a descriptive explanation and illustration of color and design theory, enhanced with your own creative projects. You will be proud of your work. Most\nimportantly, you will see the world in a whole new light. You'll see color where you didn't see it before and recognize the \\\"color magic\\\" around you. ",
