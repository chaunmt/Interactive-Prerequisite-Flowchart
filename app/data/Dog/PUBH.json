    "info": "the earliest concept of screening for disease arose in the early 1900's with the advent of x-rays, which allowed, literally, for viewing lungs on a \\\"screen\\\". the rise of screening has also been attributed to public health approaches that were employed to \\\"screen\\\" out pollutants from water or to protect from vector-borne diseases. the earliest application of x-rays was to identify tuberculosis. use of x-rays for tuberculosis led to realization that the technology allowed for the early diagnosis of latent tuberculosis, thereby offering the opportunity for treatment and control of its spread in the population. another early application of screening was to determine the mental health suitability of army recruits in world war i.  \n\nsince the world war ii era, screening for disease has become a routine part of medical care. thirty-six of the 55 u.s. preventive services task force evidence-based recommendations with an a or b grade are for screening in areas such as cancer, pregnancy, cardiovascular disease, mental health, and obesity, among others. despite the u.s. preventive services task force imprimatur on screening recommendations, routine screening is complicated not only by conflicting evidence of its efficacy, leading to disagreement among professional medical societies, but also by increasing recognition of potential physical and psychological harms that may outweigh benefits. in addition, social, economic and political forces shape screening application and policy decisions, such as whether or not to provide insurance coverage for screening tests. for example, the 2009 u.s. preventive task force recommendations to change the age at which to begin and frequency of mammography for breast cancer led to a public outcry. advocacy groups and professional medical societies opposed to the changes lobbied congress to keep the old recommendations. they claimed the revised recommendations would result in unnecessary deaths.  however, it should be noted that reducing mammography frequency and narrowing the age range for women to be screened would also likely reduce reimbursement for clinical screening services.\n\nthe aim of this course, then, is to provide a comprehensive overview of screening methods and evaluation, and to examine the efficacy, benefits versus harms, population uptake, screening promotion, and controversies surrounding specific screening tests for various health conditions. these include, but are not limited to, cancer, cardiovascular disease, infectious disease, mental health and newborn metabolic and genetic defects. such controversies can range from overdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment, informed decision-making, screening policies, and ethical issues. the course is designed to appeal to students in public health, nursing, pharmacy, medicine, genetic counseling and public policy.",

    "info": "although most of statistical inference focuses on associational relationships among variables, in many biomedical and health sciences contexts the focus is on establishing the causal effect of an intervention or treatment. drawing causal conclusions can be challenging, particularly in the context of observational data, as treatment assignment may be confounded. the first part of this course focuses on methods to establish the causal effect of a point exposure, i.e., situations in which treatment is given at a single point in time. methods to estimate causal treatment effects will include outcome regression, propensity score methods (i.e., inverse weighting, matching), and doubly robust approaches. the second half of the course focuses on estimating the effect of a series of treatment decisions during the course of a chronic disease such as cancer, substance abuse, mental health disorders, etc. methods to estimate these time-varying treatments include marginal structural models estimated by inverse probability weighting, structural nested models estimated by g-estimation, and the (parametric) g-computation algorithm. we will then turn our attention to estimating the optimal treatment sequence for a given subject, i.e., how to determine the right treatment, for the right patient, at the right time, using dynamic marginal structural models and methods derived from reinforcement learning (e.g., q-learning, a-learning) and classification problems (outcome weighted learning, c-learning). pubh 8485 is appropriate for ph.d students in biostatistics and statistics. the homework and projects will focus more on the theoretical aspects of the methods to prepare students for methodological research in this area. pubh 7485 is appropriate for masters students in biostatistics and phd students in other fields who wish to learn causal methods to apply them to topics in the health sciences. this course uses the statistical software of r, a freely available statistical software package, to implement many of the methods we discuss. however, most of the methods discussed in this course can be implemented in any statistical software (e.g., sas, stata, spss, etc.) and students will be free to use any software for homework assignments.",
