        "info": "Decisions regarding the public’s health affect all of us, and this fact could not be more apparent as we continue to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, mask and vaccination mandates have directly impacted how we interact at this university. This course is an introduction to the principles of public health, the multi-dimensional mechanisms used to reach public health goals, and the basic aspects of data collection that enable public health to promote and maintain healthy communities.The purpose of this public health course is to introduce – albeit broadly – undergraduate students to the public health approaches used to address a wide range of societal challenges. A public health approach is grounded in social justice, where people are provided basic human rights and are equality is paramount, and it emphasizes addressing challenges at the systems level. In public health we focus on prevention and population health. Students in this course will be prepared to better understand, critically evaluate, and consider how they may alleviate current and emerging challenges to the health of our global society.\nSpecifically, this course will introduce you to public health concepts that aim to protect the public’s health and wellbeing. We will discuss the leading causes of early death; the most burdensome diseases; the inter-relatedness of the environment, physiology and culture; as well as systems that have been shown to reduce threats to our health. In fact, we will specifically discuss how to approach population-based health using systems-level thinking. As we learn about the role and responsibilities of public health, we will discuss careers in public health, as well as the need and roles of other professions who help keep the public healthy.This course is appropriate for any student interested in understanding how health is protected at the population level, and how certain areas of public health contribute to many other professions including those that deal with clinical medicine, government, law, sociology, ethics and human rights/social justice. In particular, students who are interested in pursuing either the Public HealthMinor or Public Health Major should take this course to determine whether this area of study is truly of interest to them. This course is a pre-requisite to applying for the Public Health Major, and is required for the Public Health Minor.",

Students will complete the course able to identify and describe leading specific causes of disease and premature death for local, national, and global communities. Public health issues are complex, the solutions are often controversial, and resources to solve public health problems are limited.

This course will familiarize students with commonly used sources of data for public health practitioners, along with their strengths and limitations in making conclusions from those data sources. Students will then explore how to use currently available data to improve public health recommendations, which will entail an exploration of the concepts related to human disease through a basic understanding of physiology, biology, microbiology, and toxicology. This data analysis can culminate in making informed recommendations to other public health practitioners, communities, clinicians, and policy makers to solve or reduce the harms of the threats to public health. At the completion of this course, students will be able to identify, describe and discuss improvements to public health data sources expected of an entry-level public health practitioner.\n\nThere are three parts to this course: 1) Introduction to public health surveillance and other sources of public health data, such as records from sources that are not generally used for health purposes (e.g., administrative datasets such as from occupation registries or motor vehicle registrations); 2) Detailed description of the creation, implementation, and analysis of public health surveillance data; and 3) Discussion of professional issues related to these data sources, such as a formal ethics evaluation of the loss of individual privacy versus the potential benefits to the public’s health when using administrative datasets or mandatory government surveillance. Because of the amount of surveillance-related material in this course – in addition to the other times surveillance is covered in the public health major – a graduate of this program would be well positioned to get a job in governmental public health collecting surveillance data.\n\nThis course expands on the foundation courses that focus on determinants of health and health equalities. Several topics in this course are discussed in further detail, such as how determinants of health are surveilled in diverse communities, and how non-health datasets such as graduation rates help explain health inequalities. In addition, this course comes before the foundation course on public health and healthcare delivery. We will introduce topics that will prepare you for that course, such as the potential selection bias in populations of people who receive medical care in clinics, hospitals, and long-term care facilities; limitations of medical records for research; and the role of records from government-assisted health plans.\n",

But in public health, it is not enough to understand who ultimately is vulnerable but also to understand what factors have contributed to vulnerability, such as policies, behaviors (individual and societal), or physiologic response due to adverse environments. This course will examine health inequalities and the comprehensive factors that led to their existence. Special emphasis will be placed on the role of -isms on creating health disparities; these will include: racism, classism, and ableism. This course expands on the foundational course, PUBH 3213W Determinants of Health in Communities, that focuses on determinants of health. Some topics in this course expand on that course, such as how determinants of health disproportionately impact vulnerable communities. ",

        "info": "Public health engages in preventing disease, prolonging life, and improving quality of life. For most people, though, health care delivery organizations are a primary source of health-related information, and provide the means for protecting them in their journey toward a longer, and higher quality, life. Health care delivery in the U.S. accounts for 18% of national gross domestic product, 11% of US workers, and 24% of government spending. At 26%, health insurance is the largest portion of non-wage compensation, and one of the largest parts of consumer spending (over 8%). Yet despite the U.S. significantly outspending every other industrialized western country, the U.S. ranks last in important public health metrics in healthcare access and quality ratings. Further, at the population level, the U.S. has significantly more preventable deaths than comparable countries regardless of equivalent public health spending. This course takes a systems approach to survey how health care in the U.S., examining system foundations, resources, processes, and outcomes as they relate to population health. Ultimately, this course provides an introduction to how health care delivery supports public health efforts. We will use forms of inquiry from the sciences and humanities. It is designed, from a liberal education perspective, to provide opportunities to practice critical thinking skills for complex systems using hypothetical situations.\nThis course was developed with two main audiences in mind: 1) students interested in using public health as a lens to explore complex societal problems affecting health, and 2) pre-health professional students interested in a grounded understanding of the health sector. This course is designed to encourage the give-and-take between the global-view emphasis of the first group, with the attention to system-level details of the second group. As we move through the course materials, you will be asked individually to critically examine the course materials for which lenses were used in writing the material; what perspective is being heightened; what voices or perspectives were missing; why might those choices have been made; and what are the consequences of those choices. We will use group work on student-chosen specific focus areas (for example, Long-term Care, Diabetes, Drug Safety, Telehealth for Maternal Health, People with Multiple Morbidities) to explore the impact and nuances of systems-level elements. This group work will culminate in a final presentation of the portfolio developed over the course of the term. \nIf you want to learn more about health care and public health in the U.S., a public health or public policy graduate program (e.g. a Master’s of Public Health degree), would give you an opportunity to use the introduction developed here to move deeply into the topic areas using research-based approaches. This class will help you feel more confident with your path, should you decide to continue your education with graduate school. \n\nFinally, infrastructure is critical in the timely provision of both healthcare for those who are ill, as well as for public health programs for the prevention and early identification of disease. This course will describe how healthcare is structured and financed in the United States and other countries, and contrast how differences may impact national health indicators. Similarly, the role of our public health infrastructure including the responsibilities of local, state and federal public health agencies in equitable healthcare access and delivery will be described. Macro-level, systems-thinking models to address specific health issues that incorporate both healthcare and public health systems will be discussed.",

We will utilize a Geographic Information System (GIS) to incorporate and visualize data for public health research. Classwork will be presented in the form of health-related case studies where GIS helps to formulate and address scientific hypotheses based on research topics in the School of Public Health. Specifically, the ArcGIS software will be used as a tool to integrate, manipulate, and display spatial health data. Topics include understanding spatial data, mapping, topology, spatial manipulations related to data structures, online data, geocoding, remote sensing imagery, and reviewing public health literature. The course will emphasize how to prepare spatial data for a formal statistical analysis. All coursework will be discussed in the context of statistical frameworks for evaluating geostatistical, point pattern, and area-level (or lattice) data examples. \nThe intended audience for this course are masters and doctoral students who seek a more advanced understanding of GIS and spatial data beyond exploratory skills. Their goal should be a working knowledge of spatial analysis that can be readily applied in future research or employment. Students should leave this course prepared to take more advanced spatial analysis courses, map geographic trends, formulate scientific hypothesis for epidemiological applications, with the knowledge to acquire online spatial data, and the skills to critically evaluate published papers that utilize GIS.",

        "info": "Climate change presents an almost unimaginable crisis to our existence. Its profoundness is coupled with an urgency to find solutions that contribute to collective and transformative actions. There is scientific consensus that the existence of human beings (and many other species) on the planet is in danger because of fossil fuel emissions. Human activity has led to increasing greenhouse gases (especially carbon dioxide) and a warming planet. A warming planet has negative consequences in terms of environmental degradation, extreme weather events, and social disruption—all of which have health and economic consequences. While the basic problem is acknowledged by scientists in diverse fields, many of the proposed responses to the current and projected climate-related changes are contrary to powerful political, cultural, industrial, and economic interests. The challenges posed by these interests, as well as the complexity (and sometimes imprecision and uncertainty) of the science, make it difficult for individuals to clearly understand the threats and the opportunities that must be addressed in the next several decades if the earth is to remain habitable for almost 9 million species. Hearts and minds must change quickly. Public and professional educational efforts must be massive, with clear messages of hope, urgency, and direction. Local, national, and global adaptation and mitigation responses must thus be palatable and accessible to diverse communities as well as to powerful economic and political entities. Public health policies, programs, services, and educational efforts must necessarily be created by multidisciplinary teams using community-focused approaches. These efforts must reach all affected individuals and entities, especially those who are most vulnerable to the negative sequalae of climate change. They must also effectively address the many political, social, and cultural barriers to the kind of transformative actions that are necessary to maintain the habitability of the planet.\n\nThe course will take a public health perspective to encourage students to learn and critically evaluate information about three major content areas: (1) the science of climate change and its public health contextualization; (2) the existing, and projected, consequences of climate change to the environment, to human health, and to institutions and infrastructures that affect public health; and (3) public health mitigation and adaptation responses for industries, governments, communities, and individuals. A special emphasis will be placed on public health communications of climate change science, risks, and public actions.\n\nCredit will not be granted if credit has been received for PubH 7200 Climate Change and Public Health \n",

Tribes are becoming increasingly involved in more public health activities and regulations, and deliver public health services through various funding sources, grants, and contracts, alone or in collaboration with other tribes and local governments, county and state health departments.\n\nThis course provides a general basis for understanding American Indian public health and wellness.  Central to this area of study, is an appreciation to understand the unique governmental relationship based on how the federal government relates to tribal nations as distinct sovereign political entities, not as a racial classification. The trust responsibility is a government to government relationship as established in the U.S. Constitution. \n\nIn this course students will learn about the legal responsibility of the United States to the 574 federally recognized tribes, to provide health services to American Indians.  Students will examine the public health issues facing American Indian communities; review historical implications, analyze legislation, apply specific financing requirements, and gain an understanding of the unique American Indian public health system and the complex set of services, activities, collaborations, and stakeholders that varies by tribe and region.\n\nThis is a required course for those seeking a certificate or minor. It is designed to help students understand how to work respectfully and effectively with tribes and American Indian communities, to understand the basis of health services and implications of specific tribal (local and federal) law to help improve the devastating health issues currently experienced by American Indians.  \n\nWhile this course focuses on American Indian Public Health and Wellness, Health Policy, Law, Health Services Administration, there are many parallels that can be made by students related to other governance structures from around the world. The lessons can help fortify the knowledge of all students regardless of race, and culture, that can be utilized in individual professional endeavors.",

Equally important is the fact that every federally recognized tribe, of which there are 573, has their own unique traditional customs, history with other tribes, and often subpopulations within the governance of a single tribal government. The realization of understanding how populations have been driven by their respective cultures to their overall health and well-being is necessary to promote achievement of positive outcomes for stakeholders and communities.\n\nThe course will target methods to help health professionals to ensure that health services take into account individual understanding of the professional’s knowledge and how this knowledge should be respectful of individual cultural preferences.\n\nA systematic process will be provided to assist in how to learn community policies, learning processes, and traditions; as well as learning about various structures by which the culture of governments, organizations and individuals develop and support the attitudes, behaviors, practices and systems that are needed for effective cross-cultural interactions between health professionals and community members. Students will learn that ultimately, cultural humility effectiveness is determined by the individual who is receiving the services.  \n\nThe course is grounded in the understanding that cultural humility can effectively be used to strive for continuous improvement, to effectively utilize assets and address the health needs of individual American Indian communities.\n",

This is an absolute and non-negotiable function of a Tribe to ensure present and continued viability of all future generations.\n\nThis course will provide specific examples of data sharing agreements, Memorandums of Agreement or Understanding, legal basis for confidentially, discuss community readiness, and community evaluations. It is designed to help students understand how to work respectfully and effectively with Tribes and American Indian communities, and to understand the basis of research, evaluation, and collaboration. This course focuses on stakeholder driven: participation, issue identification, data sharing, and benefit to community.\n\nTo help ensure ethical and cultural values are protected an increasing number of Tribes are forming their own Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) under 45 CFR 46. The course will offer examples of Tribal IRBs and specific IRB components for American Indian populations.\n\nTribal governments represent communities with distinctive social, cultural, and spiritual qualities that embody a unique context for the review and conduct of research. This course will provide numerous examples of Tribally developed research and review mechanisms that are tailored to specific community needs and interests.\n",

        "info": "American Indian health-related problems and the lack of adequate health care and services has resulted in a disproportionate burden of disease and social suffering on the population.  History indicates that time and again health inequities are directly and indirectly associated with colonization, social support, hope, general resilient coping abilities, traditional cultural and spiritual practices, ethnic pride/enculturation, community mastery, and political inequities. \n\nIt is also important to understand how American Indians “survived” to this day.  Resilience is a major factor in understanding health and wellness equity.  It is also important to understand the unique differences between each of the 574 tribal governances, cultural traditions, respect for elders, community reciprocity, historical trauma, kinship, food security, healing, economy, social dependence and extended family of each of the 574 federally recognized tribes and American Indian Communities.\n\nWhile this course focuses on American Indian public health and wellness equity, there are many parallels that will be discussed as this history relates to other oppressed populations.  These historical lessons help fortify the knowledge of all students regardless of race, and culture, by learning accurate American Indian heath and wellness equity issues, and other experiences of “tribal-like” populations from around the World that can be utilized in individual professional endeavors. \n\nFrom the earliest days of colonization, the diseases brought from the “Old World” proved far more lethal than any weapon in the European arsenal. Infectious diseases, including measles, smallpox, and plague, among others, annihilated entire communities lost forever from history. The toll taken by infectious disease, when combined with the effects of war, the expulsion of virtually all American Indians from their ancestral lands, and the destruction of traditional American Indian ways of life, effectively destroyed the historical governance structures previously employed by American Indians.  As a consequence, American Indians became dependent on the federal government for the provision of health services as noted in the U.S. Constitution.  American Indians are dying of preventable diseases including:  diabetes, alcoholism, tuberculosis, suicide, unintentional injuries, and other health conditions at shocking rates above the general U.S. population.\n\nThis course will discuss the differences of health disparities and health assets from the Northern Plains Tribes to other regional areas and other populations.  The course will offer examples about communication plans, hopelessness behaviors, public perceptions, resilience, and social marketing in Indian Country.\nConstructs learned from this course can be advantageous for students to adapt to other unique populations around the world.  Learning how American Indian’s resiliences and assets have allowed this population to exist today are valid examples that can be utilized (with adaptations) for non-American Indian populations.  ",

The toll taken by infectious disease, when combined with the effects of war, and the expulsion of virtually all American Indians from their ancestral lands, destroyed knowledge about traditional healing plants and natural resources.

Tribes are becoming increasingly involved in more public health activities and regulation, and deliver public health services through various funding sources, grants, and contracts, alone or in collaboration with other tribes and local, county, and state health departments. The history of American Indians pre and post colonization will be discussed as it relates to the health and wellness of present day American Indians. There are significant Indigenous knowledge lessons that will be shared from American Indians who lived and continue to live upon their land (including forced relocation to non-traditional land) to help understand the relationship to the land culture and its other inhabitants today.\n\nWhile this course focuses on American Indian history, there are many parallels that will be discussed as this history relates to other oppressed populations. These historical lessons help fortify the knowledge of all students regardless of race, and culture, by learning accurate American Indian history, and other experiences of “tribal-like” populations from around the World to be utilized in individual professional endeavors. \n\nAmerican Indian tribes have had a unique history with the United States that is mixed with conflict, warfare, lack of cooperation, and lack of collaboration. This history has resulted in a complex unique web of federal Indian policy, treaties, and inter- governmental relationships. Services provided to American Indians persons have been guaranteed through treaties, executive orders, and other legal bases. The US Constitution established the current “government to government” status federally recognized tribes and tribal organizations have with the federal government.\n \nIn this course students will learn about the legal responsibility of the United States to the 574 federally recognized tribes and tribal organizations, to provide health services to American Indians.  Students will examine the public health issues facing American Indian communities by reviewing historical implications of forced acculturation, warfare, and severely underfunded health services, that has lead to health inequities. Students will examine the health status of American Indian tribes and American Indian communities, that have/are suffering needless loss of life related to preventable and treatable illness as a matter of social justice and civil rights. The hostile environment against American Indians and resulting historical trauma from the federal government will be discussed, e.g. the United State voted against the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People in 2007. The United States subsequently reversed to approve in 2010.\n\nThis course is designed to help students understand how to work respectfully and effectively with tribes and American Indian communities, to understand the accurate history and historical trauma as it relates to understanding health inequities and the devastating health issues currently experienced by American Indians.  \n\nConstructs learned from this course can be advantageous for students to adapt to other unique populations around the world.\n",

Today, while the challenges facing public health leaders, researchers and practitioners have changed, the need for Human Centered Design (HCD) competencies such as systems thinking, interdisciplinary collaboration and creativity, has only become more apparent.\n\n21st Century public health problems are what designers refer to as “wicked problems” or those problems that are difficult or impossible to solve in the traditional sense because they are complex, long-term and constantly evolving, requiring a new set of tools and approaches well suited for HCD. HCD in public health is an applied research and innovation framework that: 1) prioritizes understanding the lived experiences of those individuals and populations most familiar with, and impacted by, a challenge; 2) recognizes the role of power and privilege in designing public health systems; 3) involves an inclusive and collaborative approach throughout the design process, and; 4) promotes iterative prototyping of assumptions and ideas to learn quickly and safely into unknowns. \n\nThose looking to address complex public health challenges such as obesity, mental illness, poverty or health disparities, will need to learn how to master a variety of practices that support cross-sectored collaboration, systems thinking, creativity, experimentation and equity: Human Centered Design is an effective compliment, convener and enhancer to other core public health, public policy and health system management policies and practices.

        "title": "Screening for Disease",
        "info": "The earliest concept of screening for disease arose in the early 1900's with the advent of x-rays, which allowed, literally, for viewing lungs on a \\\"screen\\\". The rise of screening has also been attributed to public health approaches that were employed to \\\"screen\\\" out pollutants from water or to protect from vector-borne diseases. The earliest application of x-rays was to identify tuberculosis. Use of x-rays for tuberculosis led to realization that the technology allowed for the early diagnosis of latent tuberculosis, thereby offering the opportunity for treatment and control of its spread in the population. Another early application of screening was to determine the mental health suitability of army recruits in World War I.  \n\nSince the World War II era, screening for disease has become a routine part of medical care. Thirty-six of the 55 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force evidence-based recommendations with an A or B grade are for screening in areas such as cancer, pregnancy, cardiovascular disease, mental health, and obesity, among others. Despite the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force imprimatur on screening recommendations, routine screening is complicated not only by conflicting evidence of its efficacy, leading to disagreement among professional medical societies, but also by increasing recognition of potential physical and psychological harms that may outweigh benefits. In addition, social, economic and political forces shape screening application and policy decisions, such as whether or not to provide insurance coverage for screening tests. For example, the 2009 U.S. Preventive Task Force recommendations to change the age at which to begin and frequency of mammography for breast cancer led to a public outcry. Advocacy groups and professional medical societies opposed to the changes lobbied Congress to keep the old recommendations. They claimed the revised recommendations would result in unnecessary deaths.  However, it should be noted that reducing mammography frequency and narrowing the age range for women to be screened would also likely reduce reimbursement for clinical screening services.\n\nThe aim of this course, then, is to provide a comprehensive overview of screening methods and evaluation, and to examine the efficacy, benefits versus harms, population uptake, screening promotion, and controversies surrounding specific screening tests for various health conditions. These include, but are not limited to, cancer, cardiovascular disease, infectious disease, mental health and newborn metabolic and genetic defects. Such controversies can range from overdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment, informed decision-making, screening policies, and ethical issues. The course is designed to appeal to students in Public Health, Nursing, Pharmacy, Medicine, genetic counseling and public policy.\n",

        "info": "Vaccines are one of the most successful public health interventions ever developed. Yet, fundamental misconceptions about how and why vaccines work and about the scientific evidence about their efficacy and safety limit the ability of public health professionals to prevent and control the spread of vaccine-preventable diseases.\n\nVaccinology is the branch of infectious disease epidemiology that addresses these issues, building upon core concepts in epidemiologic methods and study designs to understand both the individual- and population-level impact of vaccines. In this graduate level course, students will focus on critical concepts and methods in epidemiology, infectious diseases, vaccinology, and public health needed to:\n\n1) Understand the principles of infectious disease transmission dynamics that determine how and why vaccines reduce the burden of disease\n2) Utilize epidemiologic methods and study designs to assess both individual and population-level vaccine efficacy/effectiveness\n3) Develop and implement strategies to address the challenges of achieving and maintaining high vaccine coverage in diverse communities across the US and globally.\n\nMore than 25 human diseases can be prevented by vaccination and dozens of novel and next-generation vaccines are currently under development. From ongoing efforts to eradicate polio worldwide to measles outbreaks in the US where the disease had once been eliminated to the development of fast-tracked Ebola vaccines during the West African outbreak, vaccines have taken center stage in the field of infectious diseases over the past several decades because of the incredible impact vaccines have had on saving lives, preventing disease, and preserving health. However, despite the success of vaccination programs against many serious diseases, challenges to designing, delivering, and maintaining trust in vaccines persist. Globally, vaccine-preventable diseases (pneumonia and diarrheal diseases including rotavirus) remain top causes of death in children under 5 years old. Yet vaccine access continues to be a challenge. The field of vaccinology allows us to examine, from an epidemiologic methods perspective, how and why vaccines protect individuals and populations and how and why we face challenges to achieving and maintaining high vaccine uptake among at-risk populations worldwide. In doing so, we gain the knowledge needed to develop strategies that can successfully protect all individuals from vaccine-preventable diseases. \n\nFrom the perspective of researchers, public health practitioners, and medical professionals, we will learn about numerous study designs to assess vaccine efficacy, effectiveness, and safety, and we will learn to apply communication skills critical to translating epidemiologic evidence about vaccines to the public. Specifically, we will draw upon the primary literature to understand concepts in infectious disease transmission dynamics, herd immunity, maternal immunity, and waning/boosting of immune responses. These concepts will set the foundation for understanding how and why vaccines protect both individuals and populations and how individuals interact with populations in complex ways. Throughout this course, we will apply principles of epidemiology and epi methods to understand how vaccines have successfully reduced the burden of disease in many different settings across the globe and to examine how the challenges of vaccine hesitancy, vaccine refusal, and lack of access threaten the advances that have been made in reducing the burden of infectious diseases. Students from many different disciplines who are interested in understanding why vaccines have been regarded as one of the greatest public health achievements of all time will gain a clear understanding of the essential role that they play in preventing disease and maintaining health populations.",

The staggering rate of deaths attributed to opioid overdose has received wide attention from the media and general public. Yet its origins are deeply rooted in America’s long and complicated relationship with chemical substances. This course explores the social, medical, and cultural aspects of the modern American substance use phenomenon. A social-ecological and structural determinants framework will be used to examine the public health impact of substance use disorder on individuals and communities. \n\nThe course will open with a review of the history and epidemiology of the substance use epidemic in the US. Students will then learn the fundamentals of physiological and psychological aspects of chemical dependency, including addiction treatment options. Lastly the class will examine the public health data used to describe population level substance use, including common misinterpretations of the data. The course will also feature guest speakers from clinical medicine and with personal experience of substance use disorder to broaden insights from both clinical and experiential perspectives. The course will feature a mixture of in-class lectures, readings, an in-class lab on the use of epidemiologic data, and a final project to impart a more contextual, nuanced, and in-depth understanding of substance use in modern America.\n",

Students will analyze change cases, create strategies, and respond to others as employees impacted by the change.\nIn addition, due to the fact that many managers face high-stake challenges in their roles as change agents, we will adopt the perspective of general administrative officer. In doing so, we will focus on the long-term strategic success of the health care organization, the proper positioning of the change efforts, articulating the vision, and creating a culture designed to achieve goals.\nFinally, because change management is not easily dichotomized into categories, we will not study it as such. Rather, we shall use an Organizational- Process-Leadership’ approach in order to examine how successful change is shaped, how it can be implemented, and how leaders must continually renew changes and organize to meet ongoing competitive challenges.\n",

        "info": "The course is oriented to current and future healthcare professionals and administrators who have not had previous academic exposure to legal theory, caselaw, statutory interpretation or health law related issues, and those who may or may not have previous coursework in ethics or moral philosophy. The course presents an overview of the American legal system and some of the ethical and health law issues health care leaders confront in health care service organizations. Although this course introduces basic areas of American health law and ethics, the course will emphasize contemporaneous legal and ethical issues arising in the course of everyday work of a health care leader in a health organization.\n\nHealth care is one of the most heavily regulated and legally complex industries in the United States. The course begins with a short introduction to ethics as compared with and contrasted to the American legal system and its weighing of policy values, legal precedent and intertwining of judicial, statutory and regulatory authorities. In particular, we will examine how disparities in health outcomes are created or exacerbated by these legal structures and systems and explore the ethical ramifications that result. \n\nWe will explore how the law affects the internal governance and decision making processes of health care organizations, while identifying ways that decisions made solely on the standards found in legal authorities often falls short of accounting for important ethical issues and values that arise in health care situations. Examples of specific areas we will explore include the ethical considerations or expectations and legal duties:\n\n•\tIn multiple contexts between an individual and a provider, a health plan, or an employer, especially with respect to perceptions or values of power, duty and autonomy; \n\n•\tConfidentiality, patient privacy and data security and their limits;\n\n•\tUnique standards imposed in health care transactions to prevent fraud or behaviors deemed unethical or inappropriate, such as anti-trust, false claims and anti-kickback laws; \n\n•\tObligations or expectations to provide care, especially with respect to uninsured patients and those with emergency medical conditions; \n\n•\tQuality and safety of care including malpractice, doctrines of negligence including community standard of care, disclosure of mistakes or adverse health events; \n\n•\tValues and laws regarding health plan and benefit design, including interpretations and perspectives of what constitutes and who decides what is “medically necessary;” and\n \n•\tCare decision making including informed consent and end-of-life decisions. \n\nHealth care situations raising complex legal and ethical issues involve competing perspectives, values or interests in topic areas that can be controversial in nature. This course does not aim to resolve those controversies or reach conclusions about which perspectives or interests have more merit than others. Instead, the course and our discussions will seek to highlight the tensions and balancing of interests that often underly ethical considerations and guide the legal analysis in specific situations, and how these different perspectives and interests lead to changes in society’s perceptions of ethics and its laws, and in some circumstances, to litigation as parties attempt to resolve disputes and establish ethical norms between competing interests.\n",

As a result, our social and physical environments often benefit certain groups over others, leading to health disparities. Health Impact Assessment (HIA) is a tool that uses the best-available evidence to uncover the health impacts of policies, plans and projects in order to influence decisions before they are finalized. Strong community engagement grounds the HIA in the health issues and topics important to those who will be impacted by the decision, leading to more equitable, healthier communities. \n\nThis is a skills focused course that introduces students to the six steps of an HIA, along with relevant data sources and methods. With each step, students will be given the opportunity to practice and apply key concepts. Throughout the semester, students will work in interdisciplinary teams to develop a plan for an HIA, culminating in a group presentation. Students will also critique an HIA of their choice to see how HIAs have been used in the real world. This course will also cover emerging topics and challenges in the HIA field, including data gaps, funding, intersections with government decision making processes, and public engagement in HIAs. Students will have a chance to hear from several practitioners who will share their insights and experiences conducting HIAs in Minnesota.\n",

And regardless of topic or audience, the need for writing that is clear, logical, and persuasive holds true.\n\nThis course focuses on the specific skills needed to write clearly and effectively. Students will be introduced to the concrete building blocks of strong writing at the line and paragraph level; barriers to clarity and logic flow in written communication; structural elements of persuasive essays; and effective techniques for self-editing. We will read, analyze, and discuss an array of exemplar award-winning and/or prestigiously published public health op-eds and essays, as well as targeted essays on the craft of writing clearly, logically, and persuasively at the micro (line, paragraph) and macro (essay, structure) level. We will identify how this writing style can be adapted for and improve the impact of a wide span of public health writing for various purposes and audiences.\n\nWeekly in-class writing assignments, discussions, and peer review of work-in-progress will contribute to implementing all introduced skills, while supporting the iterative production of at least one fully revised and submittable-for-publication public health opinion essay. \n",

Much less time is spent on the distinct problem of prediction, i.e., how to build a model using existing data that accurately predicts future outcomes based on individual characteristics. The prediction problem is of great interest in the health sciences; for example, the digitization of electronic health records and adoption of automated clinical decision support systems has made it possible for risk prediction algorithms to be tightly integrated into clinical care. At the same time, uncritical use of automated algorithms has the potential to increase health disparities.\n\nThis course introduces key concepts and techniques that are relevant to using and assessing prediction models for biomedical data. Students will learn how to use statistical machine learning models to predict binary outcomes (logistic regression, classification trees, support vector machines) and continuous outcomes (linear regression, regression trees, generalized additive models), and how to compare the performance of multiple models using cross-validation and sample splitting. Additional topics will include ensemble methods, feature selection, clustering, common pitfalls in the use of prediction models for biomedical data, and issues of algorithmic fairness as they relate to health equity. For the final project, students will use a dataset in a biomedical area of interest to them to build and assess the performance of a prediction model. Methods will be illustrated and implemented in R.\n",

        "info": "Although most of statistical inference focuses on associational relationships among variables, in many biomedical and health sciences contexts the focus is on establishing the causal effect of an intervention or treatment. Drawing causal conclusions can be challenging, particularly in the context of observational data, as treatment assignment may be confounded. The first part of this course focuses on methods to establish the causal effect of a point exposure, i.e., situations in which treatment is given at a single point in time. Methods to estimate causal treatment effects will include outcome regression, propensity score methods (i.e., inverse weighting, matching), and doubly robust approaches. The second half of the course focuses on estimating the effect of a series of treatment decisions during the course of a chronic disease such as cancer, substance abuse, mental health disorders, etc. Methods to estimate these time-varying treatments include marginal structural models estimated by inverse probability weighting, structural nested models estimated by G-estimation, and the (parametric) G-computation algorithm. We will then turn our attention to estimating the optimal treatment sequence for a given subject, i.e., how to determine the right treatment, for the right patient, at the right time, using dynamic marginal structural models and methods derived from reinforcement learning (e.g., Q-learning, A-learning) and classification problems (outcome weighted learning, C-learning). PubH 8485 is appropriate for Ph.D students in Biostatistics and Statistics. The homework and projects will focus more on the theoretical aspects of the methods to prepare students for methodological research in this area. PubH 7485 is appropriate for Masters students in Biostatistics and PhD students in other fields who wish to learn causal methods to apply them to topics in the health sciences. This course uses the statistical software of R, a freely available statistical software package, to implement many of the methods we discuss. However, most of the methods discussed in this course can be implemented in any statistical software (e.g., SAS, Stata, SPSS, etc.) and students will be free to use any software for homework assignments. \n\nprereq: Background in regression (e.g. linear, logistic, models) at the level of PubH 7405-7406, PubH 6450-6451, PubH 7402, or equiv.

        "info": "We will work from the definition that Population Health is the examination of large amounts of human data to address issues of health status and issues in aggregate to address the needs of large groups of people (populations). In other words, Population Health is concerned with the distribution of resources to overcome problems that drive poor health conditions in the population. This definition will be framed by the concept of Systems, which are human processes and social linkages that come together for a purpose. In this course, we will examine the factors that differentiate population health from public health, identify purpose of population health strategies, and discuss various intervention approaches. The course centers around a final project called a “Population Health Strategy.” Each week, students will learn skills and techniques that support the completion of a final project. Students will answer: \n•\tWhat’s the health problem; \n•\tWho is the population of interest; \n•\tWho are the stakeholders and partners;\n•\tWhat is the outcome you hope to improve;\n•\tHow will you achieve that goal; and\n•\tHow will you message this plan?\nAs you work to build this strategy, you will be asked to consider the social and environmental influences of illness and disease as well as many of the organizational challenges of implementation and outreach.

        "info": "This course is offered in the final term of the Executive MHA degree and is designed to enhance students' abilities to be effective leaders in health care organizations.  The course will discuss the core theory and concepts of leadership, the principles of managed and adaptive change methods, and leadership impact on teams, culture and community.  Concepts from previous courses will be reexamined, specifically in reference to their leadership implications (management, ethics, making changes in healthcare, quality and patient safety, etc.)  In addition, it is offered alongside the Capstone course so that leadership perspectives can and will be incorporated into their final Capstone deliverable. \n\nStudents will conduct 360 feedback exercises to understand their strengths and areas for improvement as a leader and use the results of that assessment to develop a plan for their personal leadership career development. We will explore leadership practices that will positively affect team outcomes, organization culture, and community relations.  Reading and online resource requirements include books, articles, video, and other talks focused on multiple facets of leadership, change, and culture.  \n\nSmall group and class discussions focus on applying concepts from the readings/online resources to leadership in a variety of health care and public health settings.  Students will be provided assignments where they will apply learnings and concepts to current leadership challenges they are experiencing.  Discussion boards will be utilized to post questions, experiences, and learnings that have occurred through experimentation and theory testing.  These learnings may be cited in the final Capstone deliverable.  \n",

Additionally, as the healthcare landscape shifts rapidly from one build upon volume to a value-based system, health systems and countries face an ever more urgent need to improve quality and safety for the populations they serve. This course will review the role of the health system leader in addressing the challenge of improving quality, safety, and value. Modules will specifically address: an overview of quality improvement and patient safety, data and common improvement models, patient safety techniques, the administrators role in the creation of the culture of safety, future trends in quality, safety, and value. \n\nCourse Goals: \na. Understand the patient, system, and population impacts of the current quality and safety challenges faced by healthcare\nb. Describe common models used for improvement work \nc. Understand the role that providers and health system leaders play in quality improvement and patient safety efforts\nd. Utilize common tools of quality and safety\ne. Balance system and personal responsibilities in quality improvement and patient safety\nf.

Additionally, this course will familiarize students with the governmental public health system in the United States. In the field of health policy, there are always multiple sides to every issue and complex political and socio-economic dynamics that create a certain level of uncertainty about what to do. This complexity makes predicting outcomes and making recommendations for policy solutions difficult. Yet decisions still need to be made and are often made given the best information available at that particular time. Providing recommendations based on an analysis of available evidence is an important part of any decision-making process. Through the use of varied writing and presentation exercises students will learn to identify issues, develop problem statements, define an audience and analyze an issue based on a set of key criteria.",

        "info": "Leadership and Leading Change, is designed for E-PHAP students who aspire to be effective leaders and effective change agents in multi-sectoral contexts. The health care sector organizations discussed will include a variety of public health settings, care delivery organizations and others including government, private and public organizations across multiple sectors.\n\nStudents explore the core concepts of leadership theory and the principles of change in organizational, community, political, social, and global settings. They use a self-assessment instrument to understand their own strengths and areas for improvement as a leader and use the results of that assessment to develop a personal leadership development plan. The readings are books and articles from the general leadership literature, from the change management literature, and from public health teaching cases.\n\nIn this hybrid course, the face-to-face portion includes small group discussions, guest speakers, exercises and class discussions that focus on applying concepts from the readings to a variety of settings. Students participate in small discussion groups; each small group will have an opportunity to lead a class discussion on assigned reading materials and their application to leadership in health care settings today. The on-line portion of the course focuses on principles of change and change strategies for public health leaders. Students post reflection notes and engage in discussion with colleagues on course content to critique, comment on relationships between concepts, and to provide personal reflections on the material as the course progresses through the on-line weeks.  The in-person portion of the course ends with an assigned paper, the personal leadership development plan. Finally, students choose one of two options for their final course paper: (1) a critique of a change project and leadership from the field, or (2) a personal project plan that demonstrates application of change and leadership strategies.\n",

        "title": "Methods for Causal Inference",
        "info": "Although most of statistical inference focuses on associational relationships among variables, in many biomedical and health sciences contexts the focus is on establishing the causal effect of an intervention or treatment. Drawing causal conclusions can be challenging, particularly in the context of observational data, as treatment assignment may be confounded. The first part of this course focuses on methods to establish the causal effect of a point exposure, i.e., situations in which treatment is given at a single point in time. Methods to estimate causal treatment effects will include outcome regression, propensity score methods (i.e., inverse weighting, matching), and doubly robust approaches.\n\nThe second half of the course focuses on estimating the effect of a series of treatment decisions during the course of a chronic disease such as cancer, substance abuse, mental health disorders, etc. Methods to estimate these time-varying treatments include marginal structural models estimated by inverse probability weighting, structural nested models estimated by G-estimation, and the (parametric) G-computation algorithm. We will then turn our attention to estimating the optimal treatment sequence for a given subject, i.e., how to determine \\\"the right treatment, for the right patient, at the right time,\\\" using dynamic marginal structural models and methods derived from reinforcement learning (e.g., Q-learning, A-learning) and classification problems (outcome weighted learning, C-learning).\n\nPubH 8485 is appropriate for PhD students in Biostatistics and Statistics. The homework and projects will focus more on the theoretical aspects of the methods to prepare students for methodological research in this area. PubH 7485 is appropriate for Masters students in Biostatistics and PhD students in other fields who wish to learn causal methods to apply them to topics in the health sciences.\n\nThis course uses the statistical software of R, a freely available statistical software package, to implement many of the methods we discuss. However, most of the methods discussed in this course can be implemented in any statistical software (e.g., SAS, Stata, SPSS, etc.) and students will be free to use any software for homework assignments.",
