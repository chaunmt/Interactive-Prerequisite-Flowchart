Among other places, students will visit the Wangensteen Historical Library of Biology and Medicine, the Goldstein Museum of Design, the University Archives, and the Conservatory on the Saint Paul campus where experts will guide them in examining specific specimens and artifacts. Students will write short response papers at each visit, often on an object of their choice.

We will investigate the historical perspectives that shaped three intersecting themes throughout the semester: the questions of geological time and of change in the study of the earth; human use of natural resources in industry and agriculture; and understandings of the earth and environment as a global system.   We will examine secondary historical scholarship and primary sources from North and South America, Africa, Europe, and Asia in order to better understand the religious and philosophical stakes of earth and environmental science, the role of empire and state building in the development of geoscience, and the interrelationship of science and industry.

You will need no more than some basic high-school algebra and geometry. We begin by studying the special theory of relativity (1905) and some of its famous predictions such as time dilation, the twin paradox, and E=mc2. While working our way through this material, we will also look at elements of nineteenth-century physics that played a role in the development of special relativity. We continue to pursue a historical approach when we turn to the general theory of relativity (1915), the theory that makes gravity part of (curved) space-time. We trace the development of this theory from 1907 till about 1920. Einstein worked intensively on this theory living in Berlin during the first World War (1914-1918). For this period, we shall also take a close look at Einstein's personal life and at his tentative first appearances on the political stage. Finally, we cover Einstein's role in the development of quantum physics, both his early pioneering efforts in this field and his later opposition to quantum mechanics as formulated in the mid-20s. By the end of the course you should have a good understanding of some of Einstein's most revolutionary ideas, of how he arrived at them, at what personal price, and in what broader socio-political and cultural context.",

In this course, we will use historical natural disasters to explore the interconnections between the structures and ideas of human society and environmental forces. Humans have not been simply the random victims of natural disasters; where and how they chose to live influenced the impact of any disastrous event.

These values and choices are almost always contentious. Through a series of historical case studies we will grapple with the big issues of right and wrong and the role of morality in a technological world.

By demonstrating the diversity of scientists in the ever changing demographics of an immigrant nation, the course argues that this diversity and the capacities of newcomers contributed to the national success in science and engineering. The engagement with science at points were used to try to limit access by women or African-Americans, but sciences was also used to discredit false theories through ever expanding emphasis on empiricism as well as attention to the social and economic consequences of innovation. The goal is to demonstrate those historical linkages in particular places and institutions as they influenced and reinforced specific scientific work, while, at the same time, being attentive to how scientific ideas and practices were shaped by American culture.",
