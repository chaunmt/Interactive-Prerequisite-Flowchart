Next are the topics of terminology and identification of embalming instruments, the importance of embalming analysis, and the completion of embalming reports. We advance to vessel location and selection, and procedures for preparing the body before the embalming process begins. We move on to the subject of embalming chemicals, with our lectures and discussions focusing on the reasons why we use various quantities and types of chemicals for each individual case.\nThe course continues with presentations focusing on treatments for embalming difficult cases, including discussion of traumatic and pathological conditions, infections, communicable diseases, autopsied bodies, organ and tissue donors, and other various conditions.","prereqInfo":"Prerequisites: MORT 2171 Introductory Human Anatomy; MORT 3171 Human Anatomy Laboratory","prereq":{"course":[{"code":"MORT 2171","subject":"MORT","id":"2171"}]}},{"code":"MORT 3062W","subject":"MORT","id":"3062W","title":"Emb II","info":"Theory and procedure of embalming.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":{"course":[]}},{"code":"MORT 3065","subject":"MORT","id":"3065","title":"Embalming Chemistry","info":"A survey of the basic principles of chemistry as relate to funeral service.
