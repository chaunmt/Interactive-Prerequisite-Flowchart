",
    "prereqInfo": "the course is divided into three parts.  in the first, well examine the meanings the music had for the people who made it and recorded it in the early decades of the twentieth century: african-american singers, blues musicians, and songsters who labored in the south under oppressive jim crow conditions and forged new musical traditions; and white appalachian peoples who were moving from farm work to work in coal mines and textile mills and combining european musical traditions with those of african-americans to create new sounds and new sonic landscapes.  in the second part of the course, well examine what the music means to us, to contemporary audiences, by analyzing recent films in which roots music is featured and its story told.  and in the third part of the course, well ask what the music has meant to scholars and analyze the ways in which, from the 1930s to the present, theyve traversed the south with notepads and recording devices to preserve the music and to learn about the musicians.  here well dip into the vast repositories of primary source material now available online (field notes, recordings, photographs, interviews) and try to find new ways to understand and appreciate roots music for ourselves, and try to solve some of its mysteries through our own research.",

    "prereqInfo": "this course will take a comparative studies approach to the development of contemporary art in its historical, its social and political contexts, the increasing influence of the western art in asia, africa, and other parts of the world, and the cross-cultural communication customs and protocols of international art practice and art criticism. methodologically, this course first aims at integrating four major disciplinary approaches in discussing art history from post-wwii to the present day: historical studies, sociological studies, psychoanalytic studies and cultural studies. such an integrated approach will provide a framework and a reference point for us to describe and understand contemporary art in certain historical and political contexts.",

    "prereqInfo": "the course is divided into three parts. in the first, we'll examine the meanings the music had for the people who made it and recorded it in the early decades of the twentieth century: african-american singers, blues musicians, and 'songsters' who labored in the south under oppressive jim crow conditions and forged new musical traditions; and white appalachian peoples who were moving from farm work to work in coal mines and textile mills and combining european musical traditions with those of african-americans to create new sounds and new sonic landscapes. in the second part of the course, we'll examine what the music means to us, to contemporary audiences, by analyzing recent films in which roots music is featured and its story told. and in the third part of the course, we'll ask what the music has meant to scholars and analyze the ways in which, from the 1930s to the present, they've traversed the south with notepads and recording devices to preserve the music and to learn about the musicians. here we'll dip into the vast repositories of primary source material now available online (field notes, recordings, photographs, interviews) and try to find new ways to understand and appreciate roots music for ourselves, and try to solve some of its mysteries.",

    "info": "sherlock holmes, in solving his cases, is relying on a pattern of reasoning known as inference to the best explanation (acronym: ibe). holmes’s explanation of how some crime was committed tends to be so convincing that it counts as evidence that it was actually committed that way. although our use of it is seldom as clever as holmes’s, we rely on ibe all the time in everyday life. so do scientists. in science, however, ibe tends to be less reliable. that a theory explains a range of phenomena does not make that theory true. in other words, we cannot simply take a theory’s explanatory power as evidence for it. yet, scientists tend to put great emphasis on their theories’ explanatory power if they want to convince others of it. which raises the question: what exactly is the relation between explanation and evidence in science? in this seminar, we will examine this relation, using  examples from everyday life, crime fiction and the history of science (involving such luminaries as copernicus, newton, darwin and einstein). to improve our understanding of ibe we will contrast it with a probabilistic account of evaluating evidence known as bayesianism.",

    "prereqInfo": "why and how was writing invented? what difference did it make to society once it was invented? who learned to read and write in antiquity, and what did they write? when people learned a writing system, did they write in their own language, or did they learn to write in the\nlanguage of the people who invented the system? and how did modern scholars figure out how to read what people once wrote in long-forgotten, extinct writing systems? these are among the questions to be explored in the seminar. we will focus on writing systems developed in and\naround the ancient near east: cuneiform in mesopotamia, proto-elamite and linear elamite in iran, hieroglyphics in egypt, the alphabet in the levant, linear a and b in the aegean, anatolian hieroglyphics, old persian cuneiform, and meroitic. the class will also examine writing systems developed in other parts of the world in antiquity: the indus valley, china, and mesoamerica. you will learn about the origins and development of the script, how it worked, what language(s) it was used to write, and what kinds of texts people wrote. in the case of extinct scripts, you will also learn the story of its decipherment – or of attempts to decipher it, in the case of scripts such as the byblian syllabary, cretan hieroglyphics, and linear a. meanwhile, we shall discuss how ancient cultures of western asia, northeastern africa, and the mediterranean influenced each other in developing their various writing systems; how people and states used particular scripts and languages for internal or external communication; and the value of literacy versus orality. examining these phenomena in diverse cultures of the ancient world will provide a wealth of analogies to the contemporary world, and will raise questions about how writing and literacy function in society and in the mind.",

    "prereqInfo": "we will look at formal film language as well as narrative concerns in order to grasp various aspects of the ideal of utopia as expressed in cinema.  through an encounter with a range of american and european films, our goal will be to consolidate an overall understanding of the politics of utopian thinking. please note that prior familiarity with film or cultural theory is not required, but all students taking a 3xxx-level honors course are expected to demonstrate their ability to think critically, write well, and make good arguments (regardless of disciplinary location).",

",
    "prereqInfo": "a note of clarification: while autobiographies tend to be chronological narratives of most of a person’s life (without the ending, of course), memoirs focus more selectively—and often without regard to linear chronology—on crucial moments or themes in the narrator’s experience.  this course prioritizes memoirs over autobiographies, and it takes most of its examples from the boom in memoir writing over the last three decades.  it does not offer a history of memoir as a genre. in particular, it features memoirs that go beyond the experiences of an individual narrator to reveal broader social and political contexts.",

    "info": "human and animal health has been significantly advanced by the creation and application of vaccines to control infectious diseases. nevertheless, there remain impactful diseases that cannot be controlled by vaccination for a variety of reasons, and global geopolitical factors often complicate public health initiatives.  further, vaccines have become controversial in some western societies, and debates have raged regarding potential negative aspects of routine vaccinations, scientific misconduct, and individual rights. this course will provide a scientific and historical background on immunity as a prelude to interdisciplinary discussion of vaccines and vaccinations.  seminars will combine didactic lectures with structured peer-to-peer interactions and debates.  students will consume both print and electronic media from multiple perspectives in order to reach their own conclusions regarding vaccines and vaccine safety. a final term paper will also inform peers as to various biological, public health, economic, regulatory, or cultural aspect of vaccines.",

    "info": "despite extensive commercial applications, a clear understanding of the adverse effects of engineered nanoparticles (enps) is lacking. a survey of the literature indicated the available information to be incomplete, independently unverified, and some may have been over-interpreted. deep uncertainties currently pervade every step of the risk assessment of enps, making the procedure incapable of properly serving its purpose. the current conventional risk assessment strategies are not applicable for enps because of their unique properties and toxicity that may not conform to the norms of classic toxicology laws. therefore, implementing some non-conventional tools in the risk assessment framework may be needed to reduce uncertainties and deliver accurate risk characterization of enps. this would enable current regulation to adequately reflect the risks of enps and protect the environment and the community. therefore, the students registered for this seminar will learn some general features of enps, how the general public might be exposed to enps, and their potential health effects so that they can make an informed decision regarding the safe use of enps. with a serious information gap regarding enps safety, whether enps are a blessing or a curse is debatable.

    "prereqInfo": "in this course, we will explore questions such as: what cultural and institutional forces allowed the scandals to occur?  what were the best ethical arguments in favor of allowing the research to proceed?  how were the scandals exposed?  what was the role of investigative reporters, regulatory authorities, and whistleblowers?  should we have confidence that research abuse is not occurring today?",
