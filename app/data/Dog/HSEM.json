    "info": "Childhood is a time of intense growth and dramatic change; of rapid physical, mental and emotional development. It is a time of discovering, experiencing, exploring; of exuberant curiosity and creativity. It is a state characterized by play and activity, innocence and wonder, surprise and delight. But childhood can also be a time of great confusion and uncertainty; of doubt, turmoil and anxiety. Through select pieces of short fiction, prose, essays and cinematic works, we will analyze the popularity of the coming-of-age genre (or Bildungsroman) as a primary mode of formative response within the African world literary tradition. We will consider how the autobiographical or semi-autobiographical story, told by a narrator who is growing up and becoming conscious of their body, their familial and wider social surroundings, their emotions, their very identity, dramatizes the cultural, political, and historical contexts in which it is set. Through our exploration of socialization as a thematic component of the Bildungsroman, we will examine how \\\"coming-of-age\\\" comes to represent something very different for boys and for girls.",

    "info": "This seminar focuses on roots music, the early twentieth century southern vernacular music that has inspired virtually every genre of American popular music over the last seven decades.  Everything from hip-hop to rock to jazz to bluegrass to Americana to folk to the singer-songwriter tradition and beyond has been profoundly shaped by the roots music well study this semester.  ",
    "prereqInfo": "The course is divided into three parts.  In the first, well examine the meanings the music had for the people who made it and recorded it in the early decades of the twentieth century: African-American singers, blues musicians, and songsters who labored in the south under oppressive Jim Crow conditions and forged new musical traditions; and white Appalachian peoples who were moving from farm work to work in coal mines and textile mills and combining European musical traditions with those of African-Americans to create new sounds and new sonic landscapes.  In the second part of the course, well examine what the music means to us, to contemporary audiences, by analyzing recent films in which roots music is featured and its story told.  And in the third part of the course, well ask what the music has meant to scholars and analyze the ways in which, from the 1930s to the present, theyve traversed the south with notepads and recording devices to preserve the music and to learn about the musicians.  Here well dip into the vast repositories of primary source material now available online (field notes, recordings, photographs, interviews) and try to find new ways to understand and appreciate roots music for ourselves, and try to solve some of its mysteries through our own research.",

As a strategy of being, these contemporary artists seem to use art to engage their audiences in a dynamic dialogue concerning certain aspects of contemporary life. These and other artists want to interpret political reality in order to change it; that is, to bring about social and political transformation through aesthetic means. This course will provide an overview of the ideas, strategies, and work of the artists as a critical lens for viewing the changing cultural and political landscape of an increasingly technological and globalized world.",
    "prereqInfo": "This course will take a comparative studies approach to the development of contemporary art in its historical, its social and political contexts, the increasing influence of the Western art in Asia, Africa, and other parts of the world, and the cross-cultural communication customs and protocols of international art practice and art criticism. Methodologically, this course first aims at integrating four major disciplinary approaches in discussing art history from post-WWII to the present day: historical studies, sociological studies, psychoanalytic studies and cultural studies. Such an integrated approach will provide a framework and a reference point for us to describe and understand contemporary art in certain historical and political contexts.",

What are they worried about, and how do they try to keep themselves safe  and secure? The quest for national security has taken shape at the level of foreign policy and military engagement. At the same time, Americans have endeavored to achieve their own safety and security through political and personal efforts. This seminar examines the various ways that citizens have addressed the issue of security in their own lives, whether their fears have been justified, and whether their efforts have kept them safe. The goal is for students to understand the issue of security in a historical context, and to enable them to be effective citizens in a world that often feels dangerous.",

    "info": "The year 2014 was the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War, one of the two most devastating wars in European history. In the ensuing three years, there have been on-going commemorations of the major battles and events that marked the wars trajectory. The importance of the war to the psyche and memory of some of the participants was illustrated when, in 2009 Harry Patch, the last surviving veteran of WWI, broke his ninety-year silence on his wartime experiences to declare that the war had been legalized mass slaughter.  When he died shortly afterwards, he was given a funeral with full military honors, which was watched by millions on television. Why did this war happen when it did and why, nearly one hundred years later, did a veteran, about whom virtually nothing was known beyond his longevity, qualify for the honors that were usually afforded generals and statesmen? Three years earlier, in 2006, the 306 British soldiers shot for cowardice were pardoned.  What does this tell us about the way mentalities about war have changed? This course will look at the history, literature, and ethics of the war that was known in French as the Der de la Der (the last of the last) and which marked over three generations of Europeans creating a legacy that was incorporated into the national identity of those taking part.",

While surveying a broad range of humor in print, on stage, and in films along with classical Jewish texts including the Torah and Talmud, students will learn about the historical and cultural contexts that make such humor not only possible, but existentially necessary, a serious business indeed. And we'll accomplish all this while laughing hysterically. \nNo prior knowledge of Jewish history and culture is required or assumed.",

    "info": "As the corporation has replaced government and the church as the dominant social institution in the industrialized world, the use of organizational advocacy as a means of persuasion has predictably increased.  One reason for this increase is that stakeholders expect and demand corporations act in accordance with social and cultural norms. Advocacy messages provide organizations with a tool for promoting change, forming attitudes, and furthering dialogue about substantive issues.  By engaging in advocacy, organizations enter into a public dialogue about issues that it views as significant in the realization of its goals and objectives.",
    "prereqInfo": "This seminar seeks to answer questions such as: What contribution does organizational advocacy make to public dialogue? How does corporate advocacy represent the goals and needs of the organization and society? What are the social implications of organizational advocacy? Our goal is to understand organizational advocacy beyond a single issue, campaign, or corporation.  To achieve our goal, we will examine a variety of communication theories and international, national, and Minnesota-based campaigns.",

    "info": "Connections between linguistics (the scientific study of human language) and biology (the scientific study of life and living forms) have a long history. Most contemporary linguists view language as part of human cognition, rooted in biologically determined predisposition to acquire language and constraints on the properties of what can be acquired. Before the Chomskyan revolution in the early 1960s, the connection was largely restricted to anatomical properties of the human vocal tract involved in articulation of speech sounds and the role of evolution of the vocal tract in making human language possible. Other connections included metaphorical borrowing of terms from biology, such as genetic relationships among related languages grouped into language families, whose members shared the same ancestor language. More recently, the focus has turned to the biological basis of human language, the existence of language genes and connections between evolution of language and evolution of the human brain. There has also been some influence of linguistic methodology on the field of biology, with researchers proposing similarities between generative models of linguistic codes (grammars) and the genetic code. This course will examine the relationship between linguistics and biology, and how it reflects development of the field of linguistics and cross-disciplinary influences in general.",

What is its meaning in our lives, why does it matter, which realities does it touch, how can it be communicated? In what way is it distributed between intellect and emotions? And why do we go to concerts, since electronic media and the internet provide such an easy access? The answers will be approached via intensive listening to all kinds of music from different cultures and epochs as well as through critical, very open discussions with the students. The instructor being highly sensitive to non-authoritarian music cultures, he may provide a thoroughly dynamic and flexible access to music.",

In order to understand both the controversy surrounding evolution and its impact on individuals and society, this course explores a variety of themes at the intersection of biology and philosophy and is co-taught by a biologist and philosopher of biology. We will investigate various dimensions of human evolution and applications of different evolutionary ideas to understanding ourselves with a special focus on health and disease. Then we turn to how humans alter or control the evolutionary process through domestication, conservation of species, and climate change. Finally, we look at the intersection of evolution and religion in the public sphere, the evolution of ideas about the human species (including questions about biological race realism), and how both culture and language evolve. We close the course by reflecting on what the future of human evolution might look like.",

We concentrate on the important problems that can be addressed using data: learning about cause and effect, prediction, converting everyday information to learn about important problems, data visualization, and much more.  Many of these topics and ideas are usually found only in more advanced courses. You will learn how to do statistical computing using the widely used and free R software, using the RStudio interface that encourages reproducible and defensible research and analysis.  Most assignments will be done in groups, and oral and written communication of work is stressed. If you only plan to take one statistics course, this is it, as it covers methods and ideas needed for a literate and numerate person in the 21st century. The only prerequisite for this course is an open mind and comfort with using numerical information. Students with a prior statistics course, such as AP statistics in high school, are invited, as the overlap will be minimal. Most student work in this course will be in groups with oral and written presentations.",

Everything from hip-hop to rock to jazz to bluegrass to \\\"Americana\\\" to folk to the singer-songwriter tradition and beyond has been profoundly shaped by the roots music we'll study this semester.",
    "prereqInfo": "The course is divided into three parts. In the first, we'll examine the meanings the music had for the people who made it and recorded it in the early decades of the twentieth century: African-American singers, blues musicians, and 'songsters' who labored in the south under oppressive Jim Crow conditions and forged new musical traditions; and white Appalachian peoples who were moving from farm work to work in coal mines and textile mills and combining European musical traditions with those of African-Americans to create new sounds and new sonic landscapes. In the second part of the course, we'll examine what the music means to us, to contemporary audiences, by analyzing recent films in which roots music is featured and its story told. And in the third part of the course, we'll ask what the music has meant to scholars and analyze the ways in which, from the 1930s to the present, they've traversed the south with notepads and recording devices to preserve the music and to learn about the musicians. Here we'll dip into the vast repositories of primary source material now available online (field notes, recordings, photographs, interviews) and try to find new ways to understand and appreciate roots music for ourselves, and try to solve some of its mysteries.",

I will have you read the biography of Einstein by Walter Isaacson and watch the season of the TV series Genius based on it. In this course, you will explore several topics covered in the book and the TV series in greater depth. Class time will be divided about equally between discussing various aspects of Einstein’s personal life and learning about Einstein’s fundamental contributions to physics. In the former category, we will look at, for instance, his attitude toward Judaism and Zionism, his view of God, his pacifism, and the relationship with his first wife, fellow student Mileva Maric. In the latter category, the goal is to provide you with a thorough understanding of the basic ideas behind special relativity, general relativity, and quantum mechanics. To achieve this goal we will only need a modest amount of mathematics, which I will develop without presupposing more than the most basic high-school algebra and geometry. Since this material, however, calls into question deeply entrenched ideas about space and time and the nature of physical reality, you should be prepared to challenge yourself, conceptually and mathematically. Your reward will be a much deeper appreciation than you may have thought possible for a non-physics/non-math major of some famous parts of Einstein’s science, including time dilation, the twin paradox, E=mc2, Minkowski space-time, curved space-time, black holes, gravitational waves, the expanding universe, cosmological constant, and quantum entanglement. By the end of the course, you should have a solid understanding of some of Einstein’s most revolutionary ideas, of how he arrived at them, at what personal price, and in what broader socio-political and cultural context.",

    "info": "This is a topical, field-trip-based course. This seminar will address some of the solutions to the environmental problems that affect our society by examining the science and by experiencing the solutions that are used on campus or in the neighboring community. Each week will focus on a solution to a different environmental issue (see schedule below). We will visit the places designed as environmental solutions, hear from the experts, and discuss the engineering and human aspects of these solutions. We will go to areas of campus that you would normally not visit or be able to visit. The field-trip destinations are accessible by campus bus, city bus, or train. The class will involve weekly reading and writing assignments. There will also be a semester-long, hands-on project to devise a realistic, potential solution to an environmental issue.",

    "info": "From interactive web-based storytelling at the New York Times to analyzing climate change data in virtual reality, data visualization - computer-based visual depiction and analysis of data - is changing the way that we understand and communicate about the world we live in. This seminar encourages aspiring activists, artists, poets, journalists, engineers, doctors, scientists, and other creative thinkers to come together to study: (1) How information is communicated visually; (2) how to use computers to create effective data visualizations; and (3) how to apply visualization to further social justice and to understand data related to social justice. In this way, the course aims to provide a visually oriented introductory experience with computer science that is applied from day one to real-world problems of critical importance to today's society. Students are expected to bring their own ideas, causes, and (optionally) datasets to the seminar. Students will study and have opportunities to create visualizations addressing gender and racial inequality, health equity, climate change, gun violence, gender identity, and more. Readings will cover a mix of current scholarly perspectives on these topics as well as technical information, such as computer programming techniques for using color, form, and metaphor to depict data using processing.org, a visual programming environment originally designed for artists. Exciting current research on virtual reality will also be discussed, for example, recent studies on virtual embodiment that aim to foster empathy for people of diverse races and genders.",

    "info": "This seminar has a STEM and a humanities component. The STEM component consists of a rigorous but algebra-based introduction to the basic formalism of quantum mechanics. This formalism is much easier to learn than most of its applications in physics (which typically require a fair amount of calculus). And mastering this basic formalism suffices to understand some of the key ideas behind such exciting recent applications as quantum computing and quantum cryptography (which will also be addressed in this seminar). The humanities component consists of a critical review of the history of the debates over the foundations of quantum mechanics from the late 1920s to the present. The seminar thus has two main objectives. The first is to introduce students with a wide variety of backgrounds to an exciting area at the intersection of physics, mathematics, and computer science challenging our understanding of the physical world but at the same time suggesting new ways of harnessing nature for our purposes. The second is to combat simplistic views of \\\"The Scientific Method\\\" by tracing in a concrete and engaging example how science is actually done—warts and all.",

    "title": "Explanation and Evidence",
    "info": "Sherlock Holmes, in solving his cases, is relying on a pattern of reasoning known as Inference to the Best Explanation (acronym: IBE). Holmes’s explanation of how some crime was committed tends to be so convincing that it counts as evidence that it was actually committed that way. Although our use of it is seldom as clever as Holmes’s, we rely on IBE all the time in everyday life. So do scientists. In science, however, IBE tends to be less reliable. That a theory explains a range of phenomena does not make that theory true. In other words, we cannot simply take a theory’s explanatory power as evidence for it. Yet, scientists tend to put great emphasis on their theories’ explanatory power if they want to convince others of it. Which raises the question: What exactly is the relation between explanation and evidence in science? In this seminar, we will examine this relation, using  examples from everyday life, crime fiction and the history of science (involving such luminaries as Copernicus, Newton, Darwin and Einstein). To improve our understanding of IBE we will contrast it with a probabilistic account of evaluating evidence known as Bayesianism.",

The environment of the frigid and heavily forested heartland of early Russian civilization, as well as that of the \\\"wild field\\\" (the Eurasian steppe) on its border, have posed a series of challenges to Russians and have left an indelible mark on modern Russian culture.  In this interdisciplinary seminar, we will study how Russians have conceived of and used nature from the medieval period to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Articulating a particular approach to nature has been integral to several ideological and cultural projects in Russian history, including the formation of a literary tradition, the establishment of a multi-ethnic empire encompassing several biomes, and the development of a vision of Soviet science conquering and reshaping nature and the world. In the period we will study (the fifteenth century to 1991 Russia) underwent several profound epistemological shifts, and a particular focus of this course will be how the ways Russians created natural knowledge changed over time. Knowledge is power, and we will study how natural knowledge was used to strengthen and expand the state in the medieval, imperial, and Soviet periods. Another major focus of this course is the ravages that nature and humankind have inflicted on one another, and we will study how the environment influenced the development of Russia's form of agricultural slavery, serfdom, as well as the history of environmental degradation, including deforestation, the establishment of heavy industry, and nuclear disaster.",

    "info": "Our world food supply faces a variety of threats: changing climates, precipitation, and disease pressures; evolving pathogens; depleted soils; even nuclear war. Our best methods for responding to these threats involve making use of crop biodiversity. To that end, genebanks collect and preserve diverse crop accessions. In order to be effective, genebank curators have to make decisions about what to preserve. Those decisions are both scientific and cultural and like any such decisions have their critics and detractors. We will discuss genetic markers and measures for population diversity and how such tools can be leveraged to gain knowledge about crop diversity, make management decisions, and create improved varieties. However, food is cultural, and for many our relationship to crops is central to identity. Therefore, we will also examine who is privileged and left out of dominant narratives, and explore alternate ways of understanding crop diversity and preservation. Finally, we will explore two case studies. The first is Seed Savers in Decorah Iowa and its ties to Midwest Agrarianism. The second is two related Peruvian organizations: The International Potato Center and Parque de la Papa. Both of these organizations preserve Peruvian native potatoes, one as part of an international NGO using the latest genetic techniques and one using traditional agricultural practices in six associated Quechua communities.",

The course will provide students with a broad exposure to the foundational principles central to addressing these interrelated issues. The readings and lectures will cover literature in systems ecology, energy and natural resources, thermodynamics, history, anthropology, human behavior, neuroscience, environmental science, sociology, economics, globalization/trade, and finance/debt with an overarching goal to give students a general understanding of how our human ecosystem functions as a whole. Such a systems overview is necessary to view the opportunities and constraints relevant to our future from a realistic starting point. Though the hard science relating to sustainability will be surveyed, few answers will be presented and it is hoped that creativity and group dialogue will lead to emergent ideas on how these big themes fit together.  While the class material is daunting and intense (reflecting our world situation), the course itself will be enlightening and deeply informative, with an open, engaging, and entertaining class atmosphere.",

    "info": "Climate change presents an almost unimaginable crisis to our existence. Its profoundness is coupled with an urgency to find solutions that contribute to collective and transformative actions. There is scientific consensus that the existence of human beings (and many other species) on the planet is in danger because of fossil fuel emissions. Human activity has led to increasing greenhouse gases (especially carbon dioxide) and a warming planet.  A warming planet has negative consequences in terms of environmental degradation, extreme weather events, and social disruption—all of which have health and economic consequences.  While the basic problem is acknowledged by scientists in diverse fields, many of the proposed responses to the current and projected climate-related changes are contrary to powerful political, cultural, industrial, and economic interests. The challenges posed by these interests, as well as the complexity (and sometimes imprecision and uncertainty) of the science, make it difficult for individuals to clearly understand the threats and the opportunities that must be addressed in the next several decades if the earth is to remain habitable for almost 9 million species. Hearts and minds must change quickly.  Public and professional educational efforts must be massive, with clear messages of hope, urgency, and direction.  Local, national, and global adaptation and mitigation responses must thus be palatable and accessible to diverse communities as well as to powerful economic and political entities.  Policies, programs, services, and educational efforts must necessarily be created by multidisciplinary teams using community-focused approaches.  These efforts must reach all affected individuals and entities, especially those who are most vulnerable to the negative sequalae of climate change.  They must also effectively address the many political, social, and cultural barriers to the kind of transformative actions that are necessary to maintain the habitability of the planet.  The course will take a multidisciplinary perspective to encourage students to learn and critically evaluate information about three major content areas: (1) the science of climate change and its public health contextualization; (2) the existing, and projected, consequences of climate change to the environment, to human health, and to institutions and infrastructures that affect public health; and (3) public health mitigation and adaptation responses for industries, governments, communities, and individuals.

Students will gain foundational understanding of the endocrine system, the pathophysiology that leads to different types of diabetes, and the pharmaceutical and lifestyle interventions for management. Students will participate in two different week-long simulations. The first simulation will be of a person living with type 1 diabetes where the student will both track their carbohydrate intake and calculate appropriate insulin doses. The second simulation will also be of a person living with diabetes and in this simulation students will need to respond to various challenges related to health system navigation and patient autonomy. In addition to simulation activities, students will debate\ncontroversial topics surrounding the care for patients with diabetes. This is an online-based course and will be discussion based. These topics will be discussed among students across each week with a strong presence of the instructional team within each small group.",

However, when such conditions exceed cell?s inner capacity, cells can undergo apoptosis, or become senescent or in some cases, they can acquire pathological properties, which lead to the progression of various human diseases. In particular, environmental changes such as climate change caused by human activities can significantly affect human health and ecosystems, and there are growing concerns about emerging new disease that is a threat to human health.",

    "title": "Writ & Read in Ancient World",
    "info": "Writing is the fundamental technology of civilization. It sets an imaginary boundary between history and prehistory, between educated and not, even between civilized and primitive, in the common way of thinking. Writing is ubiquitous today – I am doing it right now, and you are reading what I am doing – to the point that we take its nature and value for granted. This seminar scrutinizes our most universal technology and our ideas about it, by inquiring into the origins, development, disappearance, and decipherment of different writing systems.",
    "prereqInfo": "Why and how was writing invented? What difference did it make to society once it was invented? Who learned to read and write in antiquity, and what did they write? When people learned a writing system, did they write in their own language, or did they learn to write in the\nlanguage of the people who invented the system? And how did modern scholars figure out how to read what people once wrote in long-forgotten, extinct writing systems? These are among the questions to be explored in the seminar. We will focus on writing systems developed in and\naround the ancient Near East: cuneiform in Mesopotamia, proto-Elamite and linear Elamite in Iran, hieroglyphics in Egypt, the alphabet in the Levant, Linear A and B in the Aegean, Anatolian hieroglyphics, Old Persian cuneiform, and Meroitic. The class will also examine writing systems developed in other parts of the world in antiquity: the Indus Valley, China, and Mesoamerica. You will learn about the origins and development of the script, how it worked, what language(s) it was used to write, and what kinds of texts people wrote. In the case of extinct scripts, you will also learn the story of its decipherment – or of attempts to decipher it, in the case of scripts such as the Byblian syllabary, Cretan hieroglyphics, and Linear A. Meanwhile, we shall discuss how ancient cultures of western Asia, northeastern Africa, and the Mediterranean influenced each other in developing their various writing systems; how people and states used particular scripts and languages for internal or external communication; and the value of literacy versus orality. Examining these phenomena in diverse cultures of the ancient world will provide a wealth of analogies to the contemporary world, and will raise questions about how writing and literacy function in society and in the mind.",

    "info": "The question of “utopia” has been an important resource for thought – ever since the appearance in the early sixteenth century of Sir Thomas More’s tract about an imagined, ideal community in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Centered on the idea of a perfected world, utopian thinking has motivated a wide variety of political and social movements as well as literary and cultural practices. In this course, we will explore the ways that utopian ideas find expression in cinema.  We will examine the conceptions by means of which utopian longings are given cinematic form – from satires that expose the wrongs of society in order to imagine change, and culinary fantasies about the fulfillment of the senses, to the role of humor in conceptualizing change. To this we should also add the importance of considering how the visual image intimates the future – by not showing as much as by showing.",
    "prereqInfo": "We will look at formal film language as well as narrative concerns in order to grasp various aspects of the ideal of utopia as expressed in cinema.  Through an encounter with a range of American and European films, our goal will be to consolidate an overall understanding of the politics of utopian thinking. Please note that prior familiarity with film or cultural theory is not required, but all students taking a 3xxx-level honors course are expected to demonstrate their ability to think critically, write well, and make good arguments (regardless of disciplinary location).",

    "title": "Race:The History of an Idea",
    "info": "This Honors seminar explores the roots and rationales presented when constructing and upholding the idea of race. This class examines processes of racial formation in science, law, history, immigration policy, education, leisure, adoption, marriage, and medicine. The course investigates how Americans came to mythologize, understand, identify, and codify the importance of race since the mid-nineteenth century. Racial formations and classifications shift according to political climates, such that immigration debates, changing gender norms and concerns over interracial marriage transform how we imagine racial groups. We will also look at how race has been used to pathologize, eroticize, vilify, fetishize, and medicalize purported ‘problem people,’ like immigrants, the poor, and the sick. For instance, seeing people of color as particular hazards during pandemics, like the 1918 Influenza or 2020 COVID-19 crises, has deep roots in longstanding racial theories. Using memoirs, legal cases, history of medicine, laws, photographs, oral histories, and secondary source readings, this class traces the history of America’s fascination with race and how race came to define so many aspects of American life during the twentieth century.",

    "title": "Food, Clothing, Shelter",
    "info": "At a time of rising income inequality, in which billionaires grow richer while millions struggle to survive, this  course will examine the social, environmental, economic, and ethical aspects of consumption and poverty through the lens of three basic needs: food, clothing, and shelter. It seeks to help you answer three key questions: what should you eat, what should you wear, and where should you live, so that others might do the same? We will begin by exploring the historical roots of simple living in the monastic traditions of Buddhism, Hinduism, and Christianity, as well as the “voluntary simplicity” of such secular figures as Henry David Thoreau, Helen and Scott Nearing, and E. F. Schumacher. In the central portion of our course, we will consider several contemporary forms of simplicity, such as Slow Food, permaculture, and urban homesteading; visible mending, thrifting, and online reselling; and camping, #vanlife, and tiny houses. We will then compare these practices to the “basic needs” approach to economic and social development, which seeks to alleviate the “involuntary simplicity” of poverty in developing countries, as well as various attempts to address poverty in the U.S. through social welfare programs (such as SNAP, WIC, and HUD programs) and \nnongovernmental organizations (such as food shelves, soup kitchens, thrift stores, and homeless shelters). In our exploration of simple living and basic needs, we will address major issues in sustainability studies,  including ecosystem services, the gift economy, and theories of value; the positive psychology movement; the Sustainable Development Goals; and antiwork and living wage campaigns. We will also consider a range of literary and historical perspectives on food, fashion, and architecture, such as Bill McKibben’s “Deep Economy,” Marie Kondo’s “The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up,” Sarah Susanka’s “The Not So Big House,” and the documentary films “The True Cost” and “The Minimalists.” Requirements will include attendance and participation, leading discussion, a series of short reading responses, several reflective writing assignments, and a final project exploring some aspect of our subject in greater depth.",

Our examination will focus on Bernini’s sculpture and architecture that he carried out on behalf of popes and cardinals, with special emphasis given to their political, religious, and social meanings.  We will also explore Bernini’s biography and examine the style and iconography of his sculpture, architecture, and painting.  We will view Simon Schama’s 2006 film, Bernini, and, during the Spring break, have the extraordinary opportunity to study Bernini’s works first-hand in Rome.",

    "title": "History through Memoir",
    "info": "This honors seminar uses memoirs—non-fictional life stories narrated in the first person—as a lens into the past and, just as importantly, as a way to investigate what counts as “history” itself.  The relationship between personal narratives and professionally produced histories is often fraught or confused, even though both can reasonably be understood as forms of creative non-fiction.  Is the memoirist responsible to the historical record in the same way as an historian?  Does the historian know how to assess and appreciate the power of personal memory?  What kinds of memoirs do historians write?  We will examine a range of memoirs that speak variously about historical and emotional truths, about memory and identity and place, about the ability of individual experience to illuminate a broader social and political history.  We will attend to the narrator’s voice and explore how certain kinds of writing enable (even produce) certain kinds of discoveries.  Throughout, we will discuss the gains and the limitations of using personal stories to understand past experience. ",
    "prereqInfo": "A note of clarification: while autobiographies tend to be chronological narratives of most of a person’s life (without the ending, of course), memoirs focus more selectively—and often without regard to linear chronology—on crucial moments or themes in the narrator’s experience.  This course prioritizes memoirs over autobiographies, and it takes most of its examples from the boom in memoir writing over the last three decades.  It does not offer a history of memoir as a genre. In particular, it features memoirs that go beyond the experiences of an individual narrator to reveal broader social and political contexts.",

We will explore the mathematical revolution that occurred during the 17th Century that led to the development of the modern mathematical theory of probability, and we will pay special attention to the probabilistic analysis of dice games.\n2. We will explore the various philosophical puzzles that arise when we try to understand what probability claims “really mean”, and examine a number of different philosophical interpretations of probability.\n3. We will explore the recent 20th and 21st century enthusiasm for tabletop and roleplaying games, and the role that various kinds of dice play in such games.\n4. We will return to the mathematics of dice, exploring what have come to be called “crazy dice” – non-standard dice that have various unexpected properties.",

We will examine the role of dehumanization, compartmentalized thinking, and perception, personality predispositions, etc. To counterbalance the pessimism inherent in this focus, we will also examine political heroism and altruism, which often arise in response to malignant political aggression. Are these resisters ordinary or extraordinary people, and how do they differ from perpetrators? How many ethical 'kudos’ do they deserve and why? What is their role in instantiating the larger norms of ethical conduct in our political system? In examining these more general forces, we will rely on specific examples such as the holocaust, the massacre at My Lai, the rescuers of Le Chambon, and several others. Finally, through the lens developed in this seminar, we will assess U.S. government actions, and resistance to those actions, of the last four years.",

As professional historians they know their sources are necessarily selective and incomplete, and that every perspective brings its own bias.  Their own flawed memory tells them as much.  Yet they intend to capture something about their own lived experience that, when recounted with as much candor as possible, will illuminate their personal past in ways that speak to others.  When historians bring their skills of critical historical analysis to their own lives, what kinds of autobiographies do they produce?  How is their understanding of the craft of history, its methods and its limitations, reflected in their personal life stories?  We will explore how historians have engaged in what can be called a writing of the self, with a focus on the second half of the 20th century.  We will examine how they place themselves into particular social and political contexts as historical figures with a valuable perspective on their life and times.  Students will research and write their own short autobiographical pieces.",

    "info": "Trust is a central component of our lives. Without trust, we could not function as individuals, and we would not have functioning social and civic systems. How and why do humans trust? Whether face-to-face or mediated by technology, one-on-one or in groups, the basis for how we build trustworthy, durable relationships is our communication. For millennia, this communication took place with our bodies: via gestures, facial expressions, sounds, movements, and eventually, through spoken language. Later, writing and its technologies supplanted earlier forms, creating new opportunities for trust. In this seminar, we will explore the relationship between trust, technologies, and human communication by a) reviewing research from sociology, rhetoric, psychology, and other fields to understand the nature of trust; b) exploring the history of communication technology, from the oral cultures to the first forms of writing to the printing press to the Internet; c) investigating trust, technology, and communication in specific contexts, with a focus on social media and the Internet and key features such as the confirmation bias and the changing nature of expertise. These contexts will include medical/health communication; social actions; online communities; political and scientific reporting.",

Can this book be treated as a “modern novel,” or can it only be understood as a product of its times? Does the existence of a large community of writing women at this point allow us to explore a distinctive “female perspective” on this period?

For example, both narrative and storytelling are essential components of literature but they can also help doctors understand patients’ stories. Likewise, the recent documentary Still Dreaming tells the story of a production of Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream by residents in a nursing home, revealing the benefits of the literary arts for health and happiness. Throughout the semester, we will examine works that connect the world of science with the long history of recorded human experiences in the literature of illness, the body, and death. Through analysis of novels, short stories, memoirs, poetry, drama, film and television, we will explore the intersection of literary works, narrative studies, and medical narratives to address the healing power of words. This course should interest students who care about how literature makes a difference in the world, and who are curious about how medicine is related to the arts. The course may include guest speakers as well as a visit to the Center for Humanities in Medicine at the Mayo Clinic.",

    "info": "Wildland fire as an agent of renewal, vegetation change, and maintenance has been a critical process in the pine forests of the Upper Great Lakes. The vast pineries, so sought after by settler-colonialists as a commodity evolved over millennia with fire. Fires were both ‘natural’, ignited by lightning strikes, and fire was applied judiciously by Native American groups to manage landscapes and improve resources. It was an act of reciprocity: carefully tending the land to keep it healthy, while utilizing resources in return. However, the advent of effective fire suppression to protect forests first as a commodity and later for recreational enjoyment has led to substantial changes in forest communities while at the same time erasing an important cultural activity from the landscape. This seminar course explores the deep connections between fire and the emergence of Great Lakes forests, as well as the cultural use of fire as a tool. In this course, we will explore the development of effective fire suppression, the emergence of fortress-ecology/conservation, and the impacts of reduced fire activity on forest resilience. We will also discuss the concept of ‘wilderness’ and traditional ecological knowledge and the relationship with fire management today, particularly within the framework of a changing climate. This course is meant to merge interdisciplinary topics in ecology, climatology, and geography to explore the important connections between humans and their physical environment in the Upper Great Lakes pine landscapes. The course will be discussion based with frequent visits from resource professionals and the instructor’s Indigenous research collaborators.",

    "title": "Leonardo da Vinci",
    "info": "This course is designed to introduce students to Leonardo da Vinci the historical man, and to his rich body of work produced during his lifetime from 1462-1519. It is also designed to consider as well how a mythic understanding of Leonardo da Vinci was also fashioned from this same historical foundation, turning him into an almost supernatural icon of the universal creative genius. Especially noteworthy in the mythic idea of Leonardo is his seeming transcendence of the imagined “Two Cultures” divide between the Arts and the Sciences, and his identity as a virtuoso artist in multiple domains simultaneously (painting, scuplture, architecture, and the visual arts overall) a pioneering figure in science, engineering, and the history of technology in fields ranging from anatomy to hydraulics and engineering to physics. How, this course will ask, did each of these aspects of Leonardo’s work come to be a part of his historical life and accomplishments, and how after his death was his fully historical life and work refashioned into our contemporary mythistorical understanding of Leonardo as a singular universal genius and seemingly supernatural \\\"Renaissance Man\\\"? ",
    "prereqInfo": "The course will pursue these topics in three parts. Part I (Weeks 1-7) will be devoted to the historical Leonardo, and during spring break (March 3-12) we pursue Part II by traveling to Italy to experience Leonardo’s Italy as it exists today, and to start connecting the historical life with the imagined legacy of it. In Part III (weeks 12-15), we will consider the invention of the mythistory of Leonardo in the centuries after his death, especially the forging in the modern era (after 1870) of his contemporary identity as a seemingly magical and superhuman creative genius who defies interpretation in ordinary historical terms.  \n",

We will study how his artistic evolution, from folk singer to rock icon and poet, comes from his immersion in American literature and lyrics that range from traditional songs to defiant, political protest. The results are timeless uses for poetry as Dylan's music redefines how poetry influences and shapes popular culture. The main goal of the course is to come to an understanding of how his unique vision begins within the poetic traditions of the past and, as his songs redefine what poetry is, takes contemporary expression toward new definitions for literature. By the end of the course, the student of Dylan's work should master a body of knowledge and a mode of inquiry in Dylan studies and understand the role of creativity, innovation, discovery, and expression across such disciplines as American literature, folk and rock music, the history of political protest, and the popular artist in society.",

We will ask: What is development and why has it come to saturate common sense as an indispensable given of our modern existence? How should we account for the power of development in the lives of rich and poor nations, and rich and poor people? What role did the idea of development play in how the West has thought about itself in relation to the non-West? Finally, how do emerging economic powers such as China and India, who are now large donors of development aid in Africa and Latin America, imagine development in contrast to their counterparts in the West? In terms of content,  the course will introduce students to, both, the classic literature on development as well latest writings on it.",

    "info": "In the second half of the twentieth century, in the wake of World War II and decolonization, a language of human rights developed that emphasized rights as individual and universal. Many of us now take this particular notion of human rights as a given. In this seminar, we will explore the complicated and multi-faceted history of how societies in different parts of the world have defined what it is to be human, the treatment owed to humans, and various kinds of rights. Some of these philosophies are grounded in religion and others in secularism. Some identify the nation-state as the adjudicator of rights, while others would empower international organizations or grassroots movements. For some, the individual is sacrosanct, while for others, persons are inextricably embedded in social webs. We will study how these concepts have changed over time as the globe has become increasingly interconnected and consider their relevance and application in our contemporary society.",
    "prereqInfo": "The semester will be divided into five mini units. In the first, we will explore concepts of the human and of rights in major faith traditions. In the second, we will examine the debates that emerged from European colonialism in the Atlantic world. In the third, we will study the emergences of an explicit language of human rights after World War II. In the fourth, we will look at human rights issues in the United States. And in the final unit, you will pursue your own research and collaborate in small groups to make presentations and facilitate discussion around common themes.",

We learn language (together with gesture) and the tastes (textures, smells, visual features, and sounds) that we associate with food early in our lives, and both form an important part of our identities.  In this course, we will address the following questions: 1) How do we organize our language and bodies around food, i.e., how do we use them to get to and from the table and to proceed in a meal (e.g., at a sushi restaurant)? 2) How do we use language to taste, identify and assess food, and how do these fine distinctions and discriminations define us as people and relate to our identity? 3) How do we talk about our experience of food and tell stories about food? 4) What metaphors do we have for food? 5) How does language relate to gender in the context of food? 6) How is language used to socialize children around food? We will explore the relation between language and food by analyzing actual conversations among people eating a variety of foods. The conversations will be in a variety of languages (including English, Japanese, Chinese, Lao, Kri, Eegimaa, Wolof, Italian, Persian, German, Danish, French, Russian, Swedish, Dutch and Spanish).

The mechanisms we will study include restrictive racial covenants, white violence, redlining and mortgage lending, white flight to suburbs, eviction, and gentrification.  We will differentiate the individual, institutional, and systemic levels of racism and classism that contribute to the patterned inequality of housing in the United States.  \n      In addition to the housing crisis, this course will help you understand the different genres that present information.  You will analyze creative nonfiction, scholarship, law, videos, and photographs.

The relationship between personal narratives and professionally produced histories is often fraught or confused, even though both can reasonably be understood as forms of creative non-fiction.  Is the memoirist responsible to the historical record in the same way as an historian?  Does the historian know how to assess and appreciate the power of personal memory?  What kinds of memoirs do historians write?  We will examine a range of memoirs that speak variously about historical and emotional truths, about memory and identity and place, about the ability of individual experience to illuminate a broader social and political history.  We will attend to the narrator?s voice and explore how certain kinds of writing enable (even produce) certain kinds of discoveries.  Throughout, we will discuss the gains and the limitations of using personal stories to understand past experience. ",

This course prioritizes memoirs over autobiographies, and it takes most of its examples from the boom in memoir writing over the last three decades.  It does not offer a history of memoir as a genre. In particular, it features memoirs that go beyond the experiences of an individual narrator to reveal broader social and political contexts.",

When parents are incarcerated, there are collateral consequences for children, families, communities, and society. Children of incarcerated parents are at risk for a number of adverse outcomes, including behavior problems, academic difficulties, substance abuse, and criminal activity. As a liberal education course with an explicit focus on Diversity and Social Justice in the United States, we will use an interdisciplinary perspective to explore the issue of mass incarceration, focusing on the impact of incarceration on children and families. This class will include opportunities to visit local correctional facilities and engage with community-based programs serving families impacted by incarceration. Topics will include parent-child contact during incarceration, intersections between incarceration and child welfare, systemic disparities by race and class, and intergenerational cycles of incarceration.",

    "title": "The Corporation in Question",
    "info": "In the wake of the financial crisis of 2008, anti-corporate rhetoric in the U.S. reached a crescendo. Corporations – especially financial corporations – were blamed for the crisis and the misery it left in its trail. But this anger was just a spike in a long tradition of distrust and suspicion of corporations. Their legitimacy has always been in question. One of the legacies sf this tradition is the rich lode of epithets applied by Americans to corporations and their bosses including robber barons, trusts, economic royalists, malefactors of great wealth, merchants of death. The portrayal of corporations in popular entertainment – take Hollywood, for example -- is uniformly negative. The news media’s relations with corporations are predominantly adversarial. Running against corporations is a well-established way of running for elected public office.\nOne of the events that did the most to crystallize public anger was the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United v. FEC (2010) that \noverturned limits on corporate spending to influence elections to federal office. In that case, a pro-business Court was widely seen as having used an arcane legal doctrine – about legal personhood -- to hand a victory to corporate interests. Perhaps mistakenly, the issue became defined as whether corporate persons qualified for the same constitutional Free Speech rights as natural persons. A bumper sticker at the time read: “I’ll believe a corporation is a person when the state of Texas executes one.” And presidential candidate Mitt Romney was greeted with derision when he told an audience at the Iowa State Fair that “Corporations are people, my friend.” “Of course they are,” he said. “Everything corporations earn ultimately goes to people. Where do you think it goes?” The case offers an opportunity to examine both the nature of the corporation and the sources of the hostility to it.\nThis Honors seminar will try to solve is “why in America?” Why is it that, in probably the most thoroughly capitalist nation in the world, corporations are the most reviled? Of course, that the critics of corporations might answer that that is be precisely the point. Is it because it is in the United States that corporations have been left most free to plunder? The privileges in question are said to have enabled corporations to accumulate wealth. They include (1) limited liability, (2) legal personhood, (3) perpetual life, and (4) the free transferability of interests. You can see where these arguments are leading. If corporations owe their very existence to government and /or if corporations’ wealth is made possible by special privileges, then in return (it can be argued) society has the right to demand that corporations put the public interest ahead of the private interests of its shareholders. \nThis is just a sampling of the controversies that swirl around the corporation. By studying these controversies, you will gain a far deeper and more multilayered understanding of the nature of the corporation and its place in our economy and society. But the debate(s) over the corporation will also shine a light on ourselves – and our fears and hopes -- by means of our reactions to corporations. ",

In a curious twist, today it is the turn of what might be called “merchants of life” – for-profit drug companies which have saved hundreds of millions of lives – to be a pariah industry.

A survey of the literature indicated the available information to be incomplete, independently unverified, and some may have been over-interpreted. Deep uncertainties currently pervade every step of the risk assessment of ENPs, making the procedure incapable of properly serving its purpose. The current conventional risk assessment strategies are not applicable for ENPs because of their unique properties and toxicity that may not conform to the norms of classic toxicology laws. Therefore, implementing some non-conventional tools in the risk assessment framework may be needed to reduce uncertainties and deliver accurate risk characterization of ENPs. This would enable current regulation to adequately reflect the risks of ENPs and protect the environment and the community. Therefore, the students registered for this seminar will learn some general features of ENPs, how the general public might be exposed to ENPs, and their potential health effects so that they can make an informed decision regarding the safe use of ENPs. With a serious information gap regarding ENPs safety, whether ENPs are a blessing or a curse is debatable. ",

But such well-known cases represent only a small fraction of ethically contentious medical research.\n  \nIn the 1960s, for example, at the world-renowned Allen Memorial Institute at McGill University, the CIA paid psychiatric researchers to use mentally ill subjects in \\\"mind control\\\" experiments involving LSD, intensive electroconvulsive therapy, and drug-induced comas for up to three months at a time. In 1996, during a meningitis epidemic in Nigeria, researchers for the pharmaceutical company Pfizer conducted a study of an unapproved antibiotic on children without the informed consent of their parents, resulting in eleven deaths. In 2013, two neurosurgeons at the University of California-Davis were forced to resign after authorities discovered that they had intentionally implanted bacteria in the brains of cancer patients. Today, the University of Minnesota itself is under investigation after for the case of Dan Markingson, a mentally ill young man who nearly decapitated himself after allegedly being coerced into an AstraZeneca-funded psychiatric study.",

    "title": "The Politics of Legal Policy",
    "info": "The Politics of Legal Policy seminar will focus on several controversial issues involving courts and/or the types of issues they deal with. Class discussions will focus on five policy issues involving either the use and role of courts or areas in which the courts play a major role in policy administration: access to legal services, medical malpractice, scientific expert testimony, sexual predators, and judicial selection. Beyond these specific topics, students will select a specific policy issue to delve into on their own, and produce two papers: a short background memo on the nature of the issue and what is known about the facts that may make it an area in need of change, and a policy memo suggesting and advocating for possible changes. During the last three weeks, students will present their policy briefs to the seminar.",
    "prereqInfo": "The goal of the course is to understand the factual reality behind some major issues confronting the courts and the challenges of making policy changes to address these issues. Each of the five topics will be dealt with over two sessions of the seminar with the first session examining the issue from a policy perspective and the second session examining the issue from the perspective of differing political interests. Some of the sessions on policy change will involve students in the seminar debating the issue drawing upon the policy discussions from the previous week as well as their own research into the issue; other sessions may involve a guest speaker.

    "info": "Lawyers, nuns, social workers, and schoolgirls have won the Nobel Peace Prize. In achieving this distinction, they hone their leadership skills to a fine art. They face personal danger, inner conflicts, social challenges, and pointed criticism. Succeeding despite their flaws, their ability to inspire courageous, innovative action cuts across age-groups, decades, borders, and nationality. Students in this Honors Seminar will touch and experience that inspiration.",
    "prereqInfo": "Students will intensively study several extraordinary women from different cultures who have won the Prize; e.g., Aung San Suu Kyi, Leymah Gbowee, Sharin Ebadi, Mother Teresa, and Malala Yousafzai. What characterizes their leadership? What have they accomplished and at what price? How do they survive their successes, failures, and controversies? How applicable are their approaches to a student's everyday life and future? This highly interactive class will examine these questions through biographies, videos, lectures, writing, student presentations, and group discussions.",

    "info": "Police use of force incidents are at the forefront of contemporary discussions of law, politics, and culture in the United States and in Minnesota.  In this course we will examine legal and cultural issues related to the use of force by police in the United States both from a historical perspective and by examining present-day cases and events nationally and in Minnesota.  We will learn and discuss law enforcement use of force decision making through the lenses of the United States Constitution and the cases that have interpreted its meaning. Because all uses of force by law enforcement officers against free citizens is governed by 4th Amendment standards, we will begin with an understanding of 4th Amendment applicability and how it relates to policy, training, supervision, the decision to use force, and the evaluation that takes place thereafter by the courts and law enforcement policy makers. We will learn about the use of force investigative process and the litigation process that oftentimes results from a law enforcement use of force incident, particularly those incidents that result in death.\nAnalysis of specific cases will involve the review of public law enforcement data which will include police body worn camera video of graphic and violent incidents as well as relevant events occurring in the aftermath of use of use of force incidents.

    "title": "The Nature of the Cosmos",
    "info": "One of the defining features of every human civilization is its collective understanding of how the natural phenomena present to all earth dwellers  stars, planets, the earth and its transformations, plant, animal, and human  life, etc.  are conceptualized into systems of knowing. Cosmology is the term we use to describe these shared understandings, and this interdisciplinary course proposes a comparative study of different cosmologies in different civilizations and historical periods. We will explore the nature of the cosmos by first examining the category itself and what is involved in trying to study cosmology comparatively with sensitivity to cultural difference. We will then look at some different understandings of the nature of the cosmos (i.e. cosmologies) offered by different peoples in the past and around the world. We will start with two ancient, non-Western cosmologies: the Sanskrit Hindu and Buddhist traditions and the traditions of the native peoples of North America. We will then examine the history of Western cosmological thinking by looking at Greco-Roman Antiquity, Medieval Christian and Islamic cosmology, and the birth of modern, scientific cosmology in the Scientific Revolution (Galileo, Newton, etc.). Our overall goal will not be to establish a single, absolute, and universal understanding of the cosmos, but, rather, to develop an understanding of the value and power of each of the different cosmologies we will encounter and the consequences that follow from accepting one or the other of them as our point of view. Ultimately this course should help you to think more deeply, reflectively, and humanistically about the cosmologies present in our own modern globalized society today.",

Using the lenses of the humanities and sciences, we will explore topics from the full continuum of human eating. We move from hunger, starvation, and dieting to food choice and obesity, to eatings relationship to contemporary politics, culture, and racial diversity. Overarching these topics are common themes of gender roles and changing cultural norms. We will investigate how and why diets vary as well as how food has emerged as a central political problem. Students will leave this class better able to judge evidence used in diet advice and with more understanding of their own beliefs about what they should eat.",
