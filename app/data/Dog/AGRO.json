As an orientation course, it will introduce you to some of the important resources available to you as a student at the University of Minnesota in the College of Food Agricultural, and Natural Resources Sciences. A major learning objective is to increase your ability to access and utilize the primary literature in the plant sciences. This course will also introduce you to fundamental skills and best practices in managing and analyzing data that you will use in subsequent plant science courses. As a writing intensive course, you will get instruction and practice in scientific writing. This course is delivered in a hybrid (in person/online) format. This will require careful planning, self-discipline, and good time management to view pre-recorded lectures and successfully complete the various online learning activities, quizzes and assignments. The specific plant science content that you will learn will come from your research to complete a literature review assignment, reading and analyzing papers, and working with data sets from published research. The ultimate goal is to enhance your competency as a self-learner to serve you in your academic pursuit of a degree at the University of Minnesota and beyond.",

    "info": "ISome of humanity's greatest challenges are related to agriculture. The human population continues to grow and food, fuel, and fiber production are critical to improving human lives around the world. In this course, students will learn the principles of crop production and apply those principles to address real-world agricultural challenges using quantitative tools and skills. Students will learn how to find, access, and use publicly available data to better make decisions in agriculture. Group activities will require students to synthesize information from peer-reviewed research and apply that information to practical problems. This class includes trips to field research plots to collect data, organizing it, and analyzing it to test hypotheses and solve problems. Discussions and labs will be interactive and will require individual and group-level critical thinking.",
