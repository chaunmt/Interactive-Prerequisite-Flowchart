[{"code":"MM 3001W","subject":"MM","id":"3001W","title":"Manufacturing in Global Econ","info":"In this course, you'll find out just how innovative, strategic, and creative manufacturing is. The course is a great elective for students seeking a better understanding of the core sector in both U.S. and international economies. The overall objective of MM 3001W is to explore different facets of manufacturing in today's global economy, and the three dimensions of the high-performance manufacturing organization (HPMO) model--leadership, product quality, and innovation--are paramount in that exploration. You'll take a look at past and current Minnesota manufacturing companies (3M and Red Wing Shoes, for example) that are surviving and thriving in today's economy, and also learn why some of those Minnesota companies have failed. As a writing intensive course, MM 3001W also prepares students to be successful writers, both in their coursework at the University of Minnesota and in their future careers, as special attention will be paid to real-world writing applications, skills, and processes. \nPrerequisites:  None.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":{"course":[]}},{"code":"MM 3205","subject":"MM","id":"3205","title":"Engineering for Mfg Ops","info":"What makes a factory run? In this course, you'll learn all about those intricacies and gain the tools and skills required to create high-output systems that can reliably function day in, day out. You will do most of your learning through creative exercises. For example, you'll take apart a flashlight to create the tools needed for manufacturing, and you'll validate a piece of equipment while toasting a loaf of bread. Your final project will be designing and manufacturing your own holiday card. Since the best learning happens when there's flexibility to fail, the instructor creates assignments that have a little ambiguity to them. (Students can even turn in homework twice to improve their grade, if needed.) By the end of this course, you'll have the confidence to work effectively across silos, and you'll have a wealth of career advice from an instructor with over 20 years' experience leading teams at Fortune 500 companies.

You will learn three important things that can be applied directly to any job: 1) how to deconstruct the value-added steps of a manufacturing assembly, 2) how to construct a process flow diagram, and 3) how to perform a process capability study. If you want to gain expertise in how factory work is planned, measured, studied, improved, and optimized, then you've come to the right place. Beyond this, you will also walk away with an understanding that manufacturers are true artisans whose expertise shapes our world in countless ways. \nprereq: A course such as MM 3001W, or relevant manufacturing experience.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":{"course":[]}},{"code":"MM 4035","subject":"MM","id":"4035","title":"Global Supply Chain Management","info":"A supply chain is the process that ensures that any particular thing gets made and distributed efficiently and with high quality. It comprises diverse suppliers, all of whom have a different role to play. You will learn about the complex ballet that ties these suppliers together into a larger system and schedule—a supply chain. Through weekly online group work and real-life case study analysis, you will come to understand the value of interrelationships between product development, purchasing, manufacturing, customer service, and distribution. Your subject matter will be the real-world function of supply chains for familiar products, and by the end of the course, you will know how to think about effective supply chains.
