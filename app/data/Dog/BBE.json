example: genome sequencing and editing, microscopes, data\nanalysis) and other biochemical techniques, often driven by interest in emergent applications for these unique organisms. these applications include those related to protecting environmental quality as well as those related to making novel products, including materials, fuels, and chemicals. these also include understanding the roles of
