We focus on factors that determine strategic choices firms make as they build their international presence, by exploring how firms: build international presence by selecting countries, and modes of entry; benefit from national competitive advantage in developed and emerging markets; diagnose and address cultural challenges of working across borders, organize to share knowledge across borders; build and sustain their multifaceted global legitimacy; collaborate across borders; prepare their managers to address cultural, personal, and career challenges in expatriate roles and on global teams.",
