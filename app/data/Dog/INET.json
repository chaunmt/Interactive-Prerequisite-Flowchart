options for honing one?s technical expertise. but regardless of how much one can learn about the technology of it/ict, there will always be the human element and interactions that one must engage in as a professional in this world. the course is composed of three sections: (1) personal identity in it; (2) collaboration in it; and (3) it in professional contexts. in short, inet 2001 will introduce

activities and their impact within and beyond the ict world. what ethical choices must individuals make when designing new software or applications? what sorts of problems and competing interests can arise during work in organizational teams or across an industry, and how can they be resolved? more fundamentally, what impact does ict, along with the ethical decisions made by those working in the field, have on the larger world -- the communities in which it is deployed, the environment on which it operates, and the governments and economies in which it plays an ever-increasing role? to address these and related questions, inet 3011w will require you to examine ict's impact from three different perspectives: (1) the individual decision-maker; (2) the team or organizational dynamic;

(pc or server) as de facto standard, we must adapt and understand how the core components that make up an operating system change how we need to use these components. we also have the ability to consume os resources via networking like never before. what is commonly called \\\"cloud computing\\\" has now stretched what we think of a compute device across the globe as a connected system of services/processes. this course will start from the beginning of computing (briefly) to ground what we are actually trying to do with compute devices. from here, we'll understand the foundation of operating system components, but not just from a single platform. an introduction to cloud computing is essential as well, as there are many components we consume via compute devices that are across a
