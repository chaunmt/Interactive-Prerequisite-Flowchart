    "info": "this course starts from the premise that representation is where culture and politics meet, and it tests the hypothesis that pandemics radically transform representation. there are times in history when it takes a global pandemic to see the world in a different light: these are times when a pandemic makes us understand our place in the world differently. how and why do pandemics change the ways we represent the world and ourselves? or, do they? to answer these questions, we will examine a great variety of representations of life, culture, and society in the time of pandemics: we will watch films, documentaries, and musicals; we will look at photography, paintings, memes, and other visual arts; we will read novels, poems, diaries, and autobiographies; we will study works of philosophy, essays of cultural criticism, and political commentary from various media sources. we will do all that by focusing on two current and ongoing pandemics—thehiv/aids pandemic and the sars-cov-2/covid-19 pandemic. in particular, we will consider the cultural and political responses to the aids pandemic in the 1980s and 1990s and to the covid-19 pandemic in 2020, both in the u.s. and worldwide: we will investigate how these pandemics are linked to systemic oppressions (e.g., racism, misogyny, xenophobia, homophobia, transphobia), how they have transformed the relation between our individual rights and our responsibilities to society, how they have impacted sex and love and friendship, how they have changed the way we think about life and death, how they have enabled new and different forms of sociality, communication, and representation. ultimately, however, it is not only a matter of representing the world differently: it is also a question of changing it. this is where culture meets politics. the word “representation,” in fact, means not only cultural or aesthetic representation (e.g., as in the way a film represents an aspect of reality); it also means political representation (e.g., as in the way elected officials represent us in democratic governance). pandemics radically transform representation in both these senses: they transform both culture and politics. in the end, thus, the fundamental question of the course is: how can our representations of the world help bring about the change we want in the world?",

    "info": "this course explores the ethics and aesthetics of documentary cinema, arguably the very first genre of film. we will track the way documentary has widened from largely instructional and experimental uses early in its history to become a distinct genre among today’s familiar feature films. we will screen early documentaries, which may include shocking ethnographies (nanook of the north, the mad masters). over the course of the term, the syllabus makes its way to recent exemplars of the genre (films may include: amy, american teen, i am not your negro, a jihad for love, generation wealth, fetish, blackfish and so on). one of our aims will be to explore students’ relations as viewers and documentarians themselves (via smartphones, instagram, etc.) to this participatory, revelatory, and always controversial, politically fraught film practice. \n\ndocumentary cinema includes both full class lectures and discussions as well as small group discussion of films and readings, and may include the opportunity for students to create their own personal documentary. intellectually, the course balances out a study of the grammar of documentary as an artistic practice with explorations of the ways the genre reflects broader currents of cinematic and cultural history. by the end of the semester, students should have a stronger understanding of the ways documentary cinema opens our senses to the world around us.",

    "info": "in 1939, the art critic clement greenberg defined avant-garde art in opposition to the “kitsch” of mass-produced culture. to what extent does this conception of the avant-garde apply to the cinema—an institution and art form that supposedly requires machines and industrial modes of production? this course introduces students to key works of avant-garde and experimental film made by artists working on the margins of commercial film and mainstream art institutions. from the first half of the twentieth century, we will consider influential films made under the banners of futurism, constructivism, surrealism, and dada, and discuss their complex relation to hollywood commodities. in the postwar period, we will explore a range of increasingly global experimental film practices, from the queer underground cinema in latin america to the use of film projection in avant-garde performance. we will examine these practices in light of larger debates about medium specificity as well as the aesthetics and politics of the personal vs. the structural. in the final unit, we will reflect on the way contemporary artists, scholars, and curators have assembled a tradition of avant-garde cinema in the age of new media, and contemplate new directions we want it to take.",
