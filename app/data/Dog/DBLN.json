With that in mind, this intensive practical playwriting course will interrogate the tradition of theatrical writing in the Irish capital of Dublin by engaging comprehensively with a variety of modes and disciplines specific to the act of writing for the Irish stage. Contemporary Dublin has undergone an unprecedented process of modernization rarely seen in the developed world, with the city becoming in just twenty years a multicultural, cosmopolitan space that is embracing provocative ways of seeing and creating work meant for theatrical performance. Questions about the relevancy of the practice of writing in creating performance, how authorship of a play is determined, and the slipperiness of language are now at the heart of Irish theatre?s drive to redefine itself. Challenged by a wide range of disciplinary approaches to writing and rewriting, students will be exposed to a host of methodologies for creating dramatic literature for the stage specific to this unique moment in Irish theatrical history and, in the process, gain an appreciation for the important role writers still play in making theatrical performance.

This course will examine how storytelling brings Ireland to life, and how Dublin and Ireland are represented in stories. How can you use a building, a street, a painting, or a performance to construct a story that can be shared with others, and that creates a narrative that resonates with the specific time and history of that place? The course will look at the tradition of the short story in Irish writing, and also the development of the Irish novel.

The course examines how the global dimensions technology, research, capital investment, and production impact marketing, distribution, and communication networks. The breadth of this course will provide insights into the increasingly interdependent global economic and physical environment and its impact on international marketing. Globalisation has led to increasing interdependence. “Connecting the dots” has thus become essential to the survival and success of businesses, even those not operating in the international arena. By examining these linkages, students will gain an understanding of how companies develop strategic plans that are competitive to survive and succeed in these global markets. The unique localised content provided by the CAPA centres will present further regional insights into the key issues surrounding marketing from an international perspective.\n\nWith its global presence, CAPA offers students the opportunity to enrich their academic experience by exposing and exploring the localised context of the CAPA Dublin Centre.\n\nIreland is a small open economy, and its financial well-being depends largely on international trade and influenced by global markets. As one of the 27 member states of the European Union (EU), Ireland has a modern economy based on free trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) as the pathways to growth. Ireland’s high competitiveness ranking is attributed to three key areas, including access to talent, openness to foreign ideas, and agility to respond to new challenges.\n\nDublin is an entrepreneurial city and home to many of the world’s top players in technology, finance, professional services, and science and health. The vibrant culture, creative economy, and business-friendly environment make it the ideal location for students to immerse themselves while exploring a city that consistently ranks as a one the top European cities of culture and competitiveness.","prereq":[]},{"code":"DBLN 3017","subject":"DBLN","id":"3017","title":"International Economics","info":"The International Economics module provides an understanding of the key economic issues in the global business environment.

Before students explore the city, chronologically they will examine ancient Ireland’s globality in terms of its educational and religious influences, particularly on mainland Europe. Then, starting from the 10th Century, students will retrace the Viking city through to the city’s current form that is characterised by urban sprawl, multiculturalism, and its connection to Europe and the global economy. Much of the first half of the course will explore the creation of the colonial city (Georgian Dublin) and, following independence from Britain, the creation of the postcolonial city. Each of these phases in the city’s morphology can be witnessed/read through an examination of the city’s architecture, nomenclature, museums, art, and in relation to the post-colonial city, oral histories, which requires an interdisciplinary toolkit for city exploration and analysis. \n\nThe second section of the course will explore the policies that fostered the rapid speed at which Dublin grew from being a sparsely populated, non-industrial and disconnected urban space in the 1970s to a post-industrial/post-modern relatively highly populated dense plural space in the 1990s. Students will investigate the relationship between these policies and the devastating recession of the 2000s. Students will also explore the result of these rapid physical and socio-economic and cultural changes in terms of gentrification, immigration, and the complicated and contested nature of inner city residents’ notions of place, space, and identity. Students will also explore the creation of new multiethnic spaces and the city’s rebranding as a literary-cultural space (tourist Dublin). Finally, students will investigate the processes that occur in most global cities, which contribute to the creation of invisible spaces and subcultures that are found on the physical and cultural margins.","prereq":[]},{"code":"DBLN 3019","subject":"DBLN","id":"3019","title":"Ethics in the Media","info":"This course will address the principal ethical issues facing journalism, advertising, entertainment media, and online content.

GIC students also partake in out-of-class guided and self-guided activities and excursions that have been devised to enable students to become more comfortable with, and knowledgeable of, their internship locations/neighbourhoods. Furthermore, a day-long field trip illustrates how socio-political and economic factors, such as the effects of housing costs in global cities, necessitate commuting and changing work practices such as flexible working hours and working remotely that embody best practice in well-being. Field excursions vary and may also include a focus on, for example, corporate social responsibility and sustainability.\n \nThe GIC fits in with CAPA's philosophy and practice of enabling students to learn about the social and cultural context of their internship placement and the host region and country, as well as other GIC themes, through comparative global analysis. At times, this analysis will be facilitated through a small selection of CAPA Masterclasses and our “In Conversation with:_______” series given by leading professionals from a diverse range of fields. The in-class active learning approach gives students the opportunity to discuss and analyze theories and models of work, organizational behavior and management in a cross-cultural context. COVID-19 has, by necessity, and in time, by choice, increased the extent to which employees work remotely. The GIC will help students to work effectively in a partial and/or, if required, full-time remote capacity should the need arise and to demonstrate to students the competencies and skills that they will gain and demonstrate through remote engagement.\n \nA variety of teaching and learning activities will be used; for example: lecture, workshop, discussion, informal and formal presentations, self-guided and guided research, and mock (recorded) interviews. The assessment mechanisms are all designed to support learning, using the internship and living abroad experience as a vehicle. Above all, the in-class CAPA sessions give students the opportunity to listen to individual experiences, compare and contrast activities with others, and consider the experience in terms of their personal and professional development. At the beginning we focus on self-reflection, and at the end of this process we challenge each student to focus on self-projection. At its core, GIC provides an opportunity for students to unpack, synthesise, and articulate (the value of) their learning.\n \nIt is, therefore, our intention that students will treat these on-site sessions with the same dedication and professionalism that we expect the students to display at their internships. Students will undertake an intensive orientation session to help them prepare for and integrate into their placements. Additional resources and readings to aid students' personal and professional development will be provided. Central to the pedagogy of GIC is self-reflection and collaboration; we value the diverse socio-cultural and academic backgrounds our students bring to the course and see the multi- and interdisciplinary nature of GIC as a plus for discussion and collaboration. Students with prior knowledge of certain topics covered in class are encouraged to share their knowledge in a mentoring capacity with their peers and to build upon their knowledge by considering such topics from other academic disciplines and global and practical perspectives.\n \nThe content of this course is arranged around three key themes: Personal and Professional Development, Intercultural Competence, and Comparative Analysis. \n","prereq":[]}]
