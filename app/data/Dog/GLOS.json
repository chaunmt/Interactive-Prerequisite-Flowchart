The course will explore how working to collectively resolve this environmental issue requires a multi-pronged approach that enables peoples around the world to imagine--and strive for--a world that reverses the course of history, moving from climate crisis to justice.",

We will explore questions such as:  What is social justice, and how is it different from political justice or economic justice?  When does the free flow of capital and commodities involved in globalizing processes endanger possibilities for social justice, and how might we check this danger?  What about the mass migrations occurring now to Europe and elsewhere?  To what extent are these the result of historic injustices, what new social injustices might they create, what new possibilities for social justice might they enable? How and when does the emergence of social media, network technologies and the like assist in the fight for human rights and equality,  and thus enable social justice?  And under what circumstances do these technologies empower phenomena like authoritarian populism, thus undermining social justice? This course will examine theoretical texts, literature, and empirical studies from the social sciences to investigate these questions. ",

But while the declaration helped globalize human rights, the world continues to experience genocide, torture, slavery, discrimination, economic destitution, and the wide-scale displacement of people. Is it possible to reduce - or to bring an end - to these gross violations of human rights? The course seeks to imagine new strategies to address current-day human rights challenges. In the process of conceptualizing unique strategies, students examine the complex social forces that impede human rights. Students will write a strategy paper on a contemporary human rights challenge, develop a unique non-governmental organization (NGO), and participate in a simulation of the United Nations Security Council.",

We will ask what makes some situations clear and others ethically complex. We will also consider what happens when different scales of values confront each other in everyday life.

    "info": "What sets non-violence apart from other forms of political resistance is its peculiarly democratic nature. To begin with, its practitioners adhere to the principle of respecting the humanity and equality of those whom they fight against. Moreover, as Gandhi notes, it is democratic in the sense that while it requires immense self- discipline, it is nevertheless a universally available weapon. This course provides a historical exploration of some of the concepts and practices of non-violence.  The questions we shall be exploring are: Why is it only in the twentieth century that non-violence as a political ideology can be articulated?  What is the violence that non-violence eschews?  Why is the language of self-transformation and self-sacrifice so important to non-violent movements?  What specific practices of non-violence does non-violence involve?  Why do some of the most powerful practitioners of non-violence, such as Gandhi or MLK, describe their practices in religious terms?  When can non-violent politics reinforce existing injustices, or unwittingly collude in more subtle forms of violence?  When do non-violent movements succeed, and what would count as “success” for non-violent politics?   What role can and does it play in the contemporary world, which has been transformed by social media, deeper state penetration, and more intense social divisions, and where mobilizations such as BLM, the Arab Spring, or the Umbrella movement still draw on the concepts and practices of non-violence? We shall be reading both some of the most famous practitioners and thinkers of non-violence, and some of their trenchant critics—Thoreau, Gandhi, MLK, Arendt, Fanon, Thurman, Mandela, amongst others.

Class themes might include self and other, community and alienation, place and placelessness, home and homelessness. Students will examine the place of ethics and politics in the negotiation of their identities and  experiences. Assignments might include essays that ask students to interpret  artistic works that present different avenues of insight, or creative assignments that ask you to reflect on your own experiences in relation to course readings and themes.

Thanks to immense economic inequalities, wealthy families in the global North enjoy the cheap labor of Eastern European, Filipino, and Honduran nannies, house cleaners, and gardeners.

We'll examine the movement away from regulated national economies to an integrated global economy; changing patterns and organization of production, distribution, consumption, and waste disposal; and new forms of capital-labor-state relations. Some of the topics we explore include the global trade in body parts; the rise of shareholder capitalism; the new \\\"platform\\\" economy; the growing insecurity of work; and the environmental changes global capitalism has wrought.

Specific topics include the history of foundations; religion and charity; philanthropy and politics; consumption-based giving (or \\\"brand aid\\\"), and philanthropy and social policy. We'll examine case studies such as the Gates Foundation's role in African agriculture. Students will do \\\"participant observation\\\" in a local charity, and a research project on the philanthropic foundation or giving practice of their choice.",

We will ask how these practices, technologies, and policies - and the social and economic contexts that produce them - variably impact the health, well being, and valuation of particular populations.  In a series of interconnected themes, we will examine what factors produce food insecurity and for whom; where and why pollution of resources such as water happens; the history and current state of antibiotic resistance; climate change and its various effects; and how new technologies can be life-saving and life-denying according to the ways national and global policies determine who gains access and who does not.  We will also look at the innovative ways grassroots movements tackle issues confronting particular groups, what constitutes positive social change and by whose definition, and potential ways forward.

The course explores the conceptual underpinnings of human rights such as who is eligible to have rights, where those rights come from and who is responsible for guaranteeing them.  Students will learn about how international laws are made and interpreted, and will consider the geo-political context which shapes human rights laws and procedures. Because of the evolving nature of the laws and issues in this field, students are encouraged to think analytically and ethically about how to address the many human rights challenges in the world today.  The course will cover current human rights issues, including the right to health care, housing and other economic and social rights; and the right to life, freedom from torture and other civil and political rights. The course is writing intensive. The required paper for the class is a model complaint to the United Nations about a country and issue of the student's choosing. The class invites discussion and uses class exercises to engage students in the course material by shaping arguments for various legal fora. ",

And in Myanmar, a genocide against Muslim minorities is currently underway. While anti-Islamic discourses have a long history in many societies worldwide (including Muslim-majority countries), the course seeks to explore the global rise of these discourses since September 11, 2001. The course examines the cultural, political, and historical origins of Islamophobic discourses that cast Muslims as \\\"violent,\\\" \\\"hateful,\\\" and \\\"uncivilized.\\\" Class sessions will include some lecture but will be largely discussion based.

    "title": "Other Worlds",
    "info": "'Globalization' and 'Culture' are both terms that have been defined and understood in a variety of ways and the significance of which continues to be debated to the present, both inside and outside the academy.  Globalization has been talked about both as an irresistible historical force, tending toward the creation of an increasingly interconnected, or, as is sometimes claimed, an increasingly homogeneous world, and as a set of processes, the outcome of which remains open-ended and uncertain, as likely to produce new kinds of differences as universal sameness.  Culture meanwhile has been variously defined as that which distinguishes humans from other species (and which all humans therefore share) and as that which divides communities of humans from one another on the basis of different beliefs, customs, values etc. This course reflects on some of the possible meanings of both \\\"Globalization\\\" and \\\"Culture\\\" and asks what we can learn by considering them in relation to one another.  How do the phenomena associated with globalization, such as increasing flows of people, capital, goods and information across increasing distances challenge our understandings of culture, including the idea that the world is composed of so many discrete and bounded \\\"cultures\\\"? At the same time, does culture and its associated expressive forms, including narrative fiction, poetry and film, furnish us with new possibilities for thinking about globalization?  Does global interconnection produce a single, unified world, or multiple worlds?  Are the movements of people, goods, ideas and information across distances associated with new developments caused by contemporary globalization, or have they been going on for centuries or even millennia? Might contemporary debates about climate change and environmental crisis compel us to consider these phenomena in new ways?  The course addresses these questions as they have been discussed by scholars from a variety of disciplines and as they have been imagined by artists, poets, novelists and filmmakers. In doing so, it considers whether the distinctiveness of present day globalization is to be sought in part in the new forms of imagining and creative expression to which it has given rise.\n",

    "info": "For most of us, stories seem to simply 'happen.' We listen to stories, we tell stories, we are moved by stories, and we retell stories. However, every act of telling stories involves making decisions or moves, and each re-telling of a familiar story may either give birth to new meanings, nuances, and affects, or, it may erase their possibility. Thus, each storyteller can be seen as a translator of stories with a responsibility to retell stories ethically. It is precisely through these translational acts that all politics become politics of storytelling. In this course, we will consider the ways in which the politics of the global and the intimate derive their meanings, effects, and affects from the circulation, transaction, and re-tellings of stories within and across borders.  We will ask how a praxis of ethical engagement with politics can be imagined as a praxis of receiving and retelling stories. By immersing ourselves in the process of remembering, telling, listening, trimming, interweaving, distilling, and performing stories, we will consider how ethical receiving and retelling of stories involves continuous revising, repositioning, and re-theorizing of such vexed and entangled terrains and terminologies as identity, community, rights, and justice, as well as the contingent meanings of knowledge, truth, and ethics.",
    "prereqInfo": "This course engages this terrain through a mode of active learning in which all the participants will read and reflect, listen and discuss, tell and retell, watch and play, move and perform collectively. By becoming aware of the ways in which our minds-bodies-souls are inserted in the receiving and translation of stories, we will grapple together with the ways in which our bodies--as our embodiments--help to relationally shape not only our own performances but also our responses to the performances of other living and moving bodies around us.

Students will critically engage with various paradigms on the geopolitical, racial, and gender power dynamics that anchor migration processes and outcomes. Why would the movement of individuals from some parts of the world (often from the least developed regions to the highly developed Western nations) create such strong and highly charged debates? How are cross border social and economic relations of individuals and households maintained and perpetuated? What are particular governments doing to either encourage or hinder these movements? How are current migrations different from earlier eras? Is this gendered, and if so, how and why? The objective of this course is to explore the above questions through academic and policy published literature.  ",

    "info": "The world today confronts a volatile scenario shaped by three intertwined political-economic processes: First, growth in surplus value or corporate profits fueled by monopoly capitalism, wage stagnation, and automation-driven improvements in productivity; second, growth in surplus or discarded matter fueled by rising consumerism and planned obsolescence in products and services; and finally, growth in surplus humanity or under-employed, unwanted populations fueled by structural transformations in the world economy with declining opportunities for good quality jobs. The combined result manifests as widening economic inequality between the 'haves' and 'have nots'; a politically volatile situation of racialized polarization in which huge numbers of people in entire regions, countries, or sectors of the globe, have little, declining, or no access to secure waged work; and an ecological crisis where the planet finds itself ill equipped to handle growing quantities of waste matter, including greenhouse gases. Our primary focus in the course will be to understand populations that are \\\"cast out\\\" of society, the forces that produce this condition, the mechanisms of rule by which surplus populations are managed, and the way people live and cope with their superfluity.",

Other research and data agencies credit contemporary African societies with among the fastest rates of urban expansion in the world. Such stupendous demographic surge and breakneck acceleration of urban growth have engendered intense dislocation and cultural upheaval in populations caught between two competing narratives of social change: one of celebration; the other of crisis. This course explores contemporary sub-Saharan African popular cinema, popular music, TV/radio series, bus slogans, community theatre, graphic narratives, fashion, sports, and other forms of popular communication as signifiers of larger social, political, and economic processes. It examines popular cultural forms as constantly evolving expressions of social, political, and personal identities in an ever globalized and interconnected world. As sites where the tensions, frictions, collisions and notably, the productive creativities of the local and the global are circulated, negotiated and contested African popular cultures provide insights into a unique and increasingly crucial facet of contemporary African artistic practice as critical intervention. Through our discussion of art and gender, we will examine the gendering of specific popular forms, their role in hegemonic formations, as well as their subversion in resistant practices and discourses.",

Does it have a real impact on the day-to-day lives of individuals? When is it followed; when is it ignored? This course takes a broad sociological view of international law.

    "info": "For most of us, stories seem to simply 'happen.' We listen to stories, we tell stories, we are moved by stories, and we retell stories. However, every act of telling stories involves making decisions or moves, and each re-telling of a familiar story may either give birth to new meanings, nuances, and affects, or, it may erase their possibility. Thus, each storyteller can be seen as a translator of stories with a responsibility to retell stories ethically. It is precisely through these translational acts that all politics become politics of storytelling. In this course, we will consider the ways in which the politics of the global and the intimate derive their meanings, effects, and affects from the circulation, transaction, and re-tellings of stories within and across borders.  We will ask how a praxis of ethical engagement with politics can be imagined as a praxis of receiving and retelling stories. By immersing ourselves in the process of remembering, telling, listening, trimming, interweaving, distilling, and performing stories, we will consider how ethical receiving and retelling of stories involves continuous revising, repositioning, and re-theorizing of such vexed and entangled terrains and terminologies as identity, community, rights, and justice, as well as the contingent meanings of knowledge, truth, and ethics.",
    "prereqInfo": "This course engages this terrain through a mode of active learning in which all the participants will read and reflect, listen and discuss, tell and retell, watch and play, move and perform collectively. By becoming aware of the ways in which our minds-bodies-souls are inserted in the receiving and translation of stories, we will grapple together with the ways in which our bodies--as our embodiments--help to relationally shape not only our own performances but also our responses to the performances of other living and moving bodies around us.
