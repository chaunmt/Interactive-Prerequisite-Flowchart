notes, it is democratic in the sense that while it requires immense self- discipline, it is nevertheless a universally available weapon. this course provides a historical exploration of some of the concepts and practices of non-violence.  the questions we shall be exploring are: why is it only in the twentieth century that non-violence as a political ideology can be articulated?  what is the violence that non-violence eschews?  why is the language of self-transformation and self-sacrifice so important to non-violent movements?  what specific practices of non-violence does non-violence involve?  why do some of the most powerful practitioners of non-violence, such as gandhi or mlk, describe their practices in religious terms?  when can non-violent politics reinforce existing injustices, or unwittingly collude in more subtle forms of violence?  when do non-violent movements succeed, and what would count as “success” for non-violent politics?   what role can and does it play in the contemporary world, which has been transformed by social media, deeper state penetration, and more intense social divisions, and where mobilizations such as blm, the arab spring, or the umbrella movement still draw on the concepts and practices of non-violence? we shall be reading both some of the most famous practitioners and thinkers of non-violence, and some of their trenchant

understood in a variety of ways and the significance of which continues to be debated to the present, both inside and outside the academy.  globalization has been talked about both as an irresistible historical force, tending toward the creation of an increasingly interconnected, or, as is sometimes claimed, an increasingly homogeneous world, and as a set of processes, the outcome of which remains open-ended and uncertain, as likely to produce new kinds of differences as universal sameness.  culture meanwhile has been variously defined as that which distinguishes humans from other species (and which all humans therefore share) and as that which divides communities of humans from one another on the basis of different beliefs, customs, values etc. this course reflects on some of the possible meanings of both \\\"globalization\\\" and \\\"culture\\\" and asks what we can learn by considering them in relation to one another.  how do the phenomena associated with globalization, such as increasing flows of people, capital, goods and information across increasing distances challenge our understandings of culture, including the idea that the world is composed of so many discrete and bounded \\\"cultures\\\"? at the same time, does culture and its associated expressive forms, including narrative fiction, poetry and film, furnish us with new possibilities for thinking about globalization?  does global interconnection produce a single, unified world, or multiple worlds?  are the movements of people, goods, ideas and information across distances associated with new developments caused by contemporary globalization, or have they been going on for centuries or even millennia? might contemporary debates about climate change and environmental crisis compel us to consider these phenomena in new ways?  the course addresses these questions as they have been discussed by scholars from a variety of disciplines and as they have been imagined by artists, poets, novelists and filmmakers. in doing so, it considers whether the distinctiveness of present day globalization is to be sought in part in the new forms of imagining and creative expression to which it

listen to stories, we tell stories, we are moved by stories, and we retell stories. however, every act of telling stories involves making decisions or moves, and each re-telling of a familiar story may either give birth to new meanings, nuances, and affects, or, it may erase their possibility. thus, each storyteller can be seen as a translator of stories with a responsibility to retell stories ethically. it is precisely through these translational acts that all politics become politics of storytelling. in this course, we will consider the ways in which the politics of the global and the intimate derive their meanings, effects, and affects from the circulation, transaction, and re-tellings of stories within and across borders.  we will ask how a praxis of ethical engagement with politics can be imagined as a praxis of receiving and retelling stories. by immersing ourselves in the process of remembering, telling, listening, trimming, interweaving, distilling, and performing stories, we will consider how ethical receiving and retelling of stories involves continuous revising, repositioning, and re-theorizing of such vexed and entangled terrains and terminologies as identity, community, rights, and justice, as well as the contingent meanings of knowledge, truth, and ethics.\n\nthis course engages this terrain through a mode of active learning in which all the participants will read and reflect, listen and discuss, tell and retell, watch and play, move and perform collectively. by becoming aware of the ways in which our minds-bodies-souls are inserted in the receiving and translation of stories, we will grapple together with the ways in which our bodies--as our embodiments--help to relationally shape not only our own performances but also our responses to the performances of other living and moving bodies around us. \n\nwe will learn from writings, film, songs, and plays by writers, artists, activists, and thinkers from a range of historical and contemporary locations and struggles. these include: marie lily cerat, w. e. b. du bois, suheir hammad, sterlin harjo, naeem inayatullah, june jordan, analouise keating, kauanui, j. kehaulani, audre lorde, viet thanh nguyen, middle east research and information project, alok rai, nina simone, leanne betasamosake simpson, sangtin writers, standing rock collective, eve tuck, patrick wolfe, and k. wayne yang. many of the 'acts' in this course will be co-facilitated with local or international artists and writers.   \n\ngrading basis: a/f. the course requires all the participants to do sustained work and deep reflections, enjoy the process of imagining and creating with peers in a non-competitive environment.","prereqInfo":"glos 3611 is for jr or sr only. people

negotiated and contested african popular cultures provide insights into a unique and increasingly crucial facet of contemporary african artistic practice as critical intervention. through our

radical performances. \n\nreading historical, social, and performance studies, we will develop methods for analyzing performances that aim to make transformative social interventions. these include textual analysis, ethnography, performance analysis, and tracking transnational cultural exchange. you will apply select methods in your final research paper, which centers on an avant gardist cultural phenomenon in the contemporary global south.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"GLOS 5171","subject":"GLOS","id":"5171","title":"Sociology of International Law","info":"this course takes a sociological approach to international law, considering how history, institutions, power, and interests shape the phenomenon. what is international law, where does it come from, and how does it work? what does international law tell us about globalization and nation-states? does it make a difference in the world? does it have a real impact on the day-to-day lives of individuals? when is it followed; when is it ignored? this course takes a broad sociological view of international law. we analyze the actors and processes that constitute international law and then focus on particular

Movements","info":"for most of us, stories seem to simply 'happen.' we listen to stories, we tell stories, we are moved by stories, and we retell stories. however, every act of telling stories involves making decisions or moves, and each re-telling of a familiar story may either give birth to new meanings, nuances, and affects, or, it may erase their possibility. thus, each storyteller can be seen as a translator of stories with a responsibility to retell stories ethically. it is precisely through these translational acts that all politics become politics of storytelling. in this course, we will consider the ways in which the politics of the global and the intimate derive their meanings, effects, and affects from the circulation, transaction, and re-tellings of stories within and across borders.  we will ask how a praxis of ethical engagement with politics can be imagined as a praxis of receiving and retelling stories. by immersing ourselves in the process of remembering, telling, listening, trimming, interweaving, distilling, and performing stories, we will consider how ethical receiving and retelling of stories involves continuous revising, repositioning, and re-theorizing of such vexed and entangled terrains and terminologies as identity, community, rights, and justice, as well as the contingent meanings of knowledge, truth, and ethics.\n\nthis course engages this terrain through a mode of active learning in which all the participants will read and reflect, listen and discuss, tell and retell, watch and play, move and perform collectively. by becoming aware of the ways in which our minds-bodies-souls are inserted in the receiving and translation of stories, we will grapple together with the ways in which our bodies--as our embodiments--help to relationally shape not only our own performances but also our responses to the performances of other living and moving bodies around us. \n\nwe will learn from writings, film, songs, and plays by writers, artists, activists, and thinkers from a range of historical and contemporary locations and struggles. these include: marie lily cerat, w. e. b. du bois, suheir hammad, sterlin harjo, naeem inayatullah, june jordan, analouise keating, kauanui, j. kehaulani, audre lorde, viet thanh nguyen, middle east research and information project, munshi premchand, alok rai, nina simone, leanne betasamosake simpson, sangtin writers, standing rock collective, eve tuck, patrick wolfe, and k. wayne yang. many of the 'acts' in this course will be co-facilitated with local or international artists and writers.\n\ngrading basis: a/f. the course requires all the participants to do sustained work and deep reflections, enjoy the process of imagining and creating with peers in a non-competitive environment.","prereqInfo":"for graduate students only, or with instructor consent.  people from all kinds of locations and journeys are invited to join us in this collective
