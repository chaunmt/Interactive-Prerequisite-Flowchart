    "info": "Polyculture and Ecological Design is the design science of assembling plants into ecologically balanced systems. Natural polycultures are self-supporting plant communities in forests, wetlands, and prairies. Investigate ecological functions and services that are important components for sustainable horticultural design. Learn to apply the ecological landscape design language and technique while using the permaculture design process to create ecologically functional plant communities. Crucial discussions will assess the solutions in horticultural design for adapting to accelerated climate disruption, and follow natures momentum as a guide to sustainable production systems. Lab sessions will demonstrate, and you will develop, the skills and foresight needed to assess, research, concept, design, and present polycultures in a sequential and professional process.",

    "info": "This course provides an overview of the garden design process, the analysis and conceptual design of the landscape, exploration of the design characteristics of plants, sustainable design and a descriptive journey into several historical garden styles.\n\nYou will be introduced to a variety of topics, including the design process, basic design principles, and the basic concepts of graphic communication in garden design. A working knowledge of design process and principles is critical to quality design. This course is intended to strengthen student awareness and knowledge of design rather than fully develop the skills necessary to draw, develop and implement garden designs.\n\nThis course is different from fact-based horticulture science courses. Although you will be held responsible for learning a broad range of principles and processes in this course, there are typically no absolute right answers relative to design assessment and critique. What is more important is that you gain the ability to articulate and assess design character and quality and give evidence of your thought process.",

Discussions will center around scientific and non-scientific strategies, as well as limitations and strengths of the botanic garden system in regards to rare plant conservation. There are many different conservation programs around the continent and world, all of them working on different species and attacking conservation issues with different toolsets, goals, and even philosophies. Some of these gardens interact with each other and combine resources, but some do not. Some gardens work at very large scales of conservation and some work at much smaller, local scales. During this course, there will be opportunities to interact with conservation programs at other botanic gardens.",

This seminar course investigates the multiple intersections that horticultural science has with society through examining three such intersections. The first is the intersection of horticulture and psychology to understand how we can better explain individual pro-environmental behaviors as well as horticulture’s impact on health and well-being. The second intersection is horticulture and sociology, examining how current, and potential future horticultural landscapes impact communities and either reinforce or diverge from powerful social norms around ‘expected and acceptable’ landscapes. The final intersection, horticulture and policy assess how policies and ordinances impact the landscapes around us and how changing them may impact landscape-level sustainability.",
