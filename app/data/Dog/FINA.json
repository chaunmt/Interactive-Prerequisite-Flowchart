Is it all hype or this the shape of our future? Will this be another Tulip craze? How will they effect regular commerce? Are they just digital gold? How will governments step in to regulate them? Will Governments issue their own Digicoins?\nIn this course, we will not be able to answer all the above questions. However, you will gain a basic understanding of the new technology that is based on cryptography. We will discuss what it provides and where it is still lacking. We will revisit the role of money and what makes a currency successful. We will then examine the properties of cryptocurrencies and ask what it would take for them to be a store of value and/or a medium of exchange. To do this we will start with some fundamental concepts from cryptography that would allow you to understand the technology beyond some stretched analogies. We will discuss the economics of these currencies and the regulatory issues facing governments.
