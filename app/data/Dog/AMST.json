How do they fit into the U.S.'s history of immigration, race, and citizenship? Is the \\\"model minority\\\" myth really true? This course is an introduction to Asian American Studies, an interdisciplinary field that uses ethnography, literature, histories, films, memoirs, and other texts to study how the history of Asian immigration to the United States has visibly shaped existing Asian American communities and identities, and how ?Asian America? is central to a more general understanding of American popular culture and public life.\n\nThe course is roughly organized chronologically. We will first begin with an introduction to the field of Asian American Studies by asking the questions: What is Asian America? What is Asian American Studies? We will then examine important concepts, categories, and processes before exploring the rich history of Asian migration to the United States and contemporary issues facing Asian Americans today.\n\nOne of the core principles of this course is to encourage active and interdisciplinary learning. This means that we will be learning in a variety of ways to explore and understand the material (reading, writing, watching, listening, seeing, discussing, presenting). We will be drawing from a wide range of disciplines (history, law, sociology, education, cultural studies, psychology, etc.). And we will be using a variety of materials (memoir, scholarly articles, historical documents, government records, newspapers, films, photographs, popular culture, etc.) Your active participation in these activities is essential.",

Students will investigate the politics and poetics of Asian American food ways by examining social habits and rituals around food in homes, restaurants, and other public venues.

On the one hand, baseball provides a means through which the American dream has often been viewed and has itself been viewed as an idyllic representation of that dream and all that is good about American culture. But on the other hand, throughout history baseball has also reflected many of the struggles seen in the broader society. Whether it be racism, the realities of war, the place of women, the labor movement and unionization, or any of a number of other issues, baseball has provided a view into societal issues - sometimes leading the way and shining a spotlight on the issues and sometimes lagging behind other parts of society in dealing with the issues. Throughout this course we will look at these different sides of the connection between baseball and American culture.",

Yet these women’s unapologetic efforts to demand an accounting on behalf of the American people resulted in vociferous attacks by both conservative and liberal pundits. This backlash has a long history where women in power have been labeled pejoratively as demanding, as vindictive, as power-hungry, as monsters. Angry men are seen as righteous (Brett Kavanaugh), while angry women are “nasty” (Hillary Clinton). This course explores the relationship between women, rage, and politics. We consider what it means to make and claim space as women of color in politics. We look at how rage –  women’s rage, white rage, rage against women – gets mobilized to cement and/or combat racism, xenophobia, and misogyny. The course reframes women’s rage as intrepid and redemptive, capable of sparking change during this political moment. \n",

        "info": "Title VII of the of 1964 Civil Rights Act outlawed race and sex discrimination in American workplaces. Yet, employers in this time period were alternately uncertain, reluctant, or downright resistant to implementing these new antidiscrimination laws. Put another way, the change in law did not automatically result in more people of color and white women being hired or put an end to discrimination. Between 1964 and 1981, the impetus for change came from social movements such as the civil rights movement and the women’s liberation movement as they worked with or inspired unions, caucuses, and associations to push for the enforcement of federal law, thereby opening up American workplaces to people of color and white women.  To understand how activists transformed American workplaces, this course begins by focusing on the social movements of the 1960s and 1970s and their political ideals and strategies. The remainder of the course will focus on how unions, caucuses, and associations in a variety of workplaces drew from these social movements in their pursuit of racial and/or gender equality.  Not only will the course explore how these different campaigns faired, but it will also consider the questions they raise for racial and gender workplace justice in the contemporary moment.",

At the same time, Americans have endeavored to achieve their own safety and security through political and personal efforts. This seminar examines the various ways that citizens have addressed the issue of security in their own lives, whether their fears have been justified, and whether their efforts have kept them safe. The goal is for students to understand the issue of security in a historical context, and to enable them to be effective citizens in a world that often feels dangerous.",

Thus, the individual family members are not only transformed into productive citizens but are also tasked with the responsibility to reproduce the nation(alism). For example, the recent advancement for gay marriage is scripted as a new phenomenon that poses as both a threat to the American values and a sign of progress. This paradox exposes the limits of gay identity politics and nationalist ideology within neoliberalism, which later used to justify and rationalize racist and xenophobic ideologies.

        "info": "This course explores the relationship between women, rage, and politics.  Following bell hooks, we ask where is the rage?  Doing so, invites us to interrogate how rage is gendered, how politics are gendered, and how do rage and gender intersect to mobilize for justice.  Drawing on political organizing by women of color during the recent Black Lives Matter uprising, we consider what it means to make and claim space as women of color in politics.  We also look at how rage - BIPOC women's rage, white rage, rage against women - gets mobilized to cement and/or combat racism, xenophobia, and misogyny.  Finally, the course reframes women's rage as intrepid and redemptive, capable of sparking change during this political movement.",

Class sessions will provide a philosophical understanding of museum practice, your summer internship at the Minnesota Historical Society will provide practical experience inside the workings of a major state historical organization.  The course is critical part of the History Museum Fellows Program, in identifying and addressing issues of how traditionally marginalized  communities are represented in the traditional narrative of history – both in Minnesota museums and in museums with national audiences. \n\nThe course and associated Fellowship Program will create a unique opportunity for students to strengthen undergraduate coursework with a one-of-a-kind seminar, explore career interests and receive assistance in exploring options for graduate training as a museum professional.
