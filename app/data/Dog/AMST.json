in american cultural production such as film and literature. on the one hand, baseball provides a means through which the american dream has often been viewed and has itself been viewed as an idyllic representation of that dream and all that is good about american culture. but on the other hand, throughout history baseball has also reflected many of the struggles seen in the broader society. whether it be racism, the realities of war, the place of women, the labor movement and unionization, or any of a number of other issues, baseball has provided a view into societal issues - sometimes leading the way and shining a spotlight on the issues and sometimes lagging behind other parts of society in dealing with the issues. throughout this course we will look at these different sides of

an accounting on behalf of the american people resulted in vociferous attacks by both conservative and liberal pundits. this backlash has a long history where women in power have been labeled pejoratively as demanding, as vindictive, as power-hungry, as monsters. angry men are seen as righteous (brett kavanaugh), while angry women are “nasty” (hillary clinton). this course explores the relationship between women, rage, and politics. we consider what it means to make and claim space as women of color in politics. we look at how rage –  women’s rage, white rage, rage against women – gets mobilized to cement and/or combat racism, xenophobia, and misogyny. the course reframes women’s rage as intrepid and redemptive, capable of sparking change during this political moment.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"AMST 1915","subject":"AMST","id":"1915","title":"In Pursuit of Equality","info":"title vii of the of 1964 civil rights act outlawed race and sex

way, the change in law did not automatically result in more people of color and white women being hired or put an end to discrimination. between 1964 and 1981, the impetus for change came from social movements such as the civil rights movement and the women’s liberation movement as they worked with or inspired unions, caucuses, and associations to push for the enforcement of federal law, thereby opening up american workplaces to people of color and white women.  to understand how activists transformed american workplaces, this course begins by focusing on the social movements of the 1960s and 1970s and their political ideals and strategies. the remainder of the course will focus on how unions, caucuses, and associations in a variety of workplaces drew from these social movements in their pursuit of racial and/or gender equality.  not only will the course explore how these different campaigns faired, but it will also consider the questions they raise for racial and gender workplace justice in the contemporary moment.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"AMST 1918","subject":"AMST","id":"1918","title":"American Quest for Security","info":"for more than half a century,
