The course will highlight the role of women in their relation with family, with other African/nonAfrican peoples, as well as the role of women of the border regions of Sahel-Savanna, SavannaForest, within the country of Morocco, and along the Indian Ocean-Swahili Coast and Atlantic Coast frontiers. AFRO 1009 will compare the roles of African women from specific regions to others in different times and places in Africa, as well as with their contemporaries in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. We will consider the ways in which the women under scrutiny played a critical role in the dynamic changes that transformed their worlds and the worlds around\nthem. Indeed, the historical lens that informs and underpins this course is premised on the understanding that people make change and that change does not just happen in and of itself. In recognizing the process of change over time, AFRO 1009 emphasizes the significance of social\nand cultural context in shaping the extent and nature of women’s participation in these processes. Therefore, the course will seek to understand the cultural beliefs and the rich ethnic, economic, religious networks, which buttressed the women’s roles and examine their associated factors. In\naddition to stressing the importance of change over time, AFRO 1009 engages students in a reflection of the past in an attempt to understand those reflections within the continuum of past, present, and future. Accordingly, AFRO 1009 impels us to think about the long term effects of\nany change, however slight or insignificant it may seem.",

We will explore why people of African descent have occupied an oppressed position in this culture and globally and how they have resisted this oppression creating social change. Our major form of analysis is historical sociology, as well as the arts and humanities. We will examine changes over time and employ sociological, economic, cultural, and political tools for understanding the historical and contemporary positioning of African Americans. We will be centrally concerned with how domination, race, gender, and class shape Black life in the U.S. and how resistance and change have occurred. In our analyses we take seriously the deep intersectionality of systems of oppression as well as historic resistance to oppression. Critical race theory and Black feminist theory are important frames for our work. Moreover, the significance of the cultural creativity of African peoples is foundational to our understanding. We must be concerned with how Black people see themselves today. How social change is imagined in the 21st century informs our work.",

But childhood can also be a time of great confusion and uncertainty; of doubt, turmoil and anxiety. Through select pieces of short fiction, prose, essays and cinematic works, we will analyze the popularity of the coming–of–age genre (or bildungsroman) as a primary mode of formative response within the African world literary tradition. We will consider how the autobiographical or semi-autobiographical story, told by a narrator who is growing up and becoming conscious of their body, their familial and wider social surroundings, their emotions, their very identity, dramatizes the cultural, political, and historical contexts in which it is set. Through our exploration of socialization as a thematic component of the bildungsroman, we will examine how “coming-of-age” comes to represent something very different for boys and for girls.",

Within a few short years, shows like College Hill and America’s Next Top Model began pushing the genre to centralize the experiences of black cast members and, today, reality shows that feature solely or predominately black casts are among the most successful of the genre. For some people, the proliferation of reality television and the roles black people have played in it has been welcome, while for others it has been a major cause for concern, particularly given the complex history of black representation in U.S. public culture. In this course, we will consider what is at stake in the cultural battles over reality television and the fraught history of black media representation. The final six weeks of the course will be dedicated to a reality television-style competition in which students will be expected to work in groups.\n\n",

        "info": "Increasing and intensifying inequality is perhaps the most pressing socio-economic problem of our time. A significant threat to democracy, the American dream, and national values of diversity and inclusion, wealth inequality today has not only surpassed that of the Great Depression but also grafted onto longstanding, intersectional cleavages of race, gender, indigeneity, class, and sexuality. The richest one percent have captured nearly 60 percent of all income gains from 1977 to 2000, and in 2010, the top 20 percent of households owned almost 90 percent of all privately held wealth in the United States, while the net worth of the bottom 40 percent was negative. Simultaneously, much of the current political polarization, cultures of resentment, and rise in scapegoating and racist anti-immigrant actions have also been attributed to the attendant consequences of rising inequality, anxiety, and insecurity. \n\nAnd yet, many social critics argue that instead of addressing the key causes of inequality and the crisis of the American dream, the powerful in society have seized on these conditions to mobilize an avalanche of discontent among sectors of the downwardly mobile in a way that often obscures the key reasons for their predicament and scapegoats those at the social margins. Given this context, it is imperative to better understand and analyze the histories, cultural assumptions, and hierarchies that have produced contemporary inequality. How did we get to this point? What are the consequences, and what might we expect in the future? This set of seminars asks these hard questions and engages in precisely this exploration.  \n\nThese four freshman seminars (AFRO 1917, ANTH 1917, GWSS 1917, HIST 1917) will occasionally meet together, and will bring together scholars across multiple disciplines (African American Studies, Anthropology, Feminist Studies, History, and beyond) who are substantively engaged with scholarship on class, race, indigeneity, gender, and sexuality. We believe that this cross-fertilization is critical because the fault-lines of inequality have precisely cohered to these structural formations and categories of analysis.",

While the exact number remains unknown, it is estimated that over 10 million Africans arrived in the New World over a period of 400 years. Most of them were bound for Central and South America with less than half a million arriving to the British colonies in North America. At the dawn of the 21st Century, however, U.S. census figures determined that more Africans had arrived in the United States voluntarily since 1990, than the total amount brought in as captives. This course examines the impact of African migrations in the Atlantic World beginning with the explorations of Portuguese mariners down the coast of West Africa in the 15th century, which set the foundation for the trans-Atlantic slave trade.",

The continent is endowed with a hugely diverse environment, ranging from desert to equatorial rainforest, as well as diverse cultures. Africa?s various natural and cultural environments have played a part in shaping human activities, including agriculture, trade, and technology ? which in turn have shaped the nature of the cities and states that have emerged across the continent. Technological innovations such as irrigation have allowed complex societies to develop and grow in an otherwise inhospitable desert climate with limited natural resources. Although the prevalence of animal diseases and all-year-round rainfall restricted surplus agricultural production by affecting the use of animals as a source of draft power and cultivation of cereal crops, advances in technology, including ironwork and adoption of the tropical rainforest crops, facilitated the transformation of the physical environment and emergence of cities and states in the rainforest. The course examines how the nature of early agriculture, the environment, and technology shaped the history of African societies to equip learners with a better understanding of the contemporary social and environmental challenges. It assesses the dynamism in the relation between African societies and the environment over time.",

In South Africa, we have seen the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures implemented to control it causing massive social upheaval and personal distress. It has forced the people in the country to confront issues that life prior to the pandemic had made easy to turn away from. Misogyny, gender based violence, and sexual violence, a long-standing emergency in the south of Africa, have been forced into our vision once again. It was not the pandemic that created this violence. Nor was it the first time people had been outraged by a lack of action to address it. In the years approaching 2020, calls, protests and demonstrations were increasingly demanding the culture of impunity in gender based violence be ended; sometime with violent outcomes against the protestors themselves. Over those same years, nationwide protests have rocked South Africa's university campuses. The student movements known as #RhodesMustFall, #FeesMustFall and #RUReferenceList highlight the contrasts and disappointments of the recent past in South Africa, confront the legacy of racism and misogyny in its institutions and knowledge systems, and resonate with a history of anti-racism and struggle that now, in turn, similarly fuel the on-going Black Lives Matter and #MeToo movements worldwide.",

It will consider the union of African elements and European elements that combined to present a new syncretized African-American product. To do this it is imperative that we explore the diversity of musical “voices” found within the African American culture. This diversity can be seen in the struggles to retain African cultural effects and the desire to be eclectic, creative, and contemporary. Such an approach to the study of the place of Black music in American music corresponds with the criteria of Diversity and Social Justice in the United States Liberal Education. The “multi-layered operation of power, prestige, and privilege” can be understood through an examination of the music of African Americans, which represents both a Free African voice and an enslaved African voice; the western-trained Black performer/composer and the self-taught performer/composer. It also represents the habits of well-to-do African Americans and the poor African Americans. Students will examine the complexities of the history of African Americans and how this is played out in the development of musical styles and genres. From this, students will then begin to understand how this unique diversity within a community affects those outside of those communities. Such an approach to the study of the place of Black music in American music corresponds with the criteria of Diversity and Social Justice in the United States Liberal Education.\n\nWe will follow elements found in West African culture and music such as \\\"call and response\\\" and the \\\"2nd Line\\\" as they travel to the \\\"New World\\\" and expressed through Spirituals, Symphonies, Gospel Music, Jazz, Rock and Roll, Step Bands and more. Through lectures, readings, discussion, audiovisual examples, and homework assignments student can expect to gain a deeper understanding of the ways music both reflects and influences the social history of all Americans.",

We will discuss the experiences and struggles of enslaved Africans in the Americas, struggles against slavery, the ways in which we can understand histories of Blackness, and different forms of struggle employed by Afro-descendant populations today. At the end of the semester students will have a solid grounding in the literature around Black Geographies, as well as a nuanced understanding of the different ways in which Black populations analyze and create space.",

What distinguishes it, however, is the contested nature of state borders, which have been redrawn in ways not observed anywhere else in Africa since the end of European colonialism. The purpose of this class is to delve deeper into these conflicts, to examine the interactions between incumbent governments, armed rebel groups and international actors in shaping war and peace in the Horn. Throughout this journey, we will pay special attention to ideas of sovereignty, identity and violence and draw on literature outside of the Horn to help us better dissect what is going on within it.

There rarely, if ever, is a serious discussion of the underlying causes of this instability.  Instead, it is implicitly assumed that this is the natural order of events in the Dark Continent.  This course challenges the racially inspired cultural arrogance which underlies assumptions about Africa and explores it with the long-term structural and historical roots of the crises which confront many parts of Africa.  It is a course about Africans and how they responded to the challenges and legacies that date back to the colonial period and before.  Throughout this course we will be concerned with African initiatives in a rapidly changing political, economic, social, and ideological context and the changing ways that the Global North has represented Africa. In doing so we will be fight for a more accurate history of Africa.",

As sites where the tensions, frictions, collisions and notably, the productive creativities of the local and the global are circulated, negotiated and contested, African popular cultures provide insights into a unique and increasingly crucial facet of contemporary African artistic practice as critical intervention. The course is designed on the premise that Africans of all social strata and lifestyles are strategic and deliberate consumers of popular cultural forms, generated within local cultures as signifiers of larger social, political, and economic processes. In light of prevailing studies which sometimes end up naively celebrating agency and resistance, AFRO 3578 underscores the role of popular cultures as public/private sites of power's ideological and material (re-) production, contestation, or transformation. It considers creative practices as sites of both resistance and accommodation; of creative adaptation, innovation, and resilience. Through our discussion of communication technologies and their role in transmitting artistic and political ideas beyond the confines of dominant discourses and established institutions, we will evaluate the interface of technology and sociocultural shifts.",

In the United States and in Western Europe specifically, the consequence of this mobility—immigration—remains the single most cross-cutting issue and the most vexed political challenge of the day. Defined as threatening and intrusive, frequently criminalized in discourse and in action, immigrants have become scapegoats for a wide range of problems that bedevil every aspect of life in every country. Blamed for everything from taking jobs from locals to rising crime and the spread of communicable diseases, immigrants have become victims of xenophobic violence and repositories for the routine fear-mongering prevalent in post-9/11 global terror and counter-terror climate. This course addresses the keys issues that arise in contemporary immigration and global security debates. Throughout the course of the semester, we will interrogate the literary and audio-visual arts as a mirror of the times, reflecting socio-political conditions. In a bid to place the current “crisis” in a historical perspective, we will examine select works by African writers, filmmakers and artists, which provide examples that enable us to move beyond stereotypes and common assumptions.",

We will contrast postcolonial African films with Hollywood jungle epics, settler/adventure romances in safari paradise, and colonial movies about Africa.

How have interactive virtual fictions and creative non-fictions changed the process of writing and the definition of \\\"legitimate\\\" literature, of which the novel is a characteristic product? How do interactive fictions help to raise fundamental questions about what literature is, as well as shed light on classical literary techniques and strategies such as narrative perspectives, questions of genre, reader-response and intertextuality? How does digital storytelling as a vector of the global imaginary serve as an especially appropriate tool for coping with the pangs of being uprooted from familiar ground? We will examine the ways in which individuals endeavor to articulate their identity and sense of belonging in unhomely and occasionally untimely situations. How do transnational online communities help mitigate experiences of exclusion, as well as shape individuals’ perspectives on citizenship and social membership?",

It also examines the interplay between food security, indigenous knowledge, and environmental sustainability by comparing various standpoints on African food production, scrutinizing the challenges the continent is facing and the unique perspectives it offers in terms of agricultural development in the globalized world. Finally, the course examines how agricultural systems in Africa are affected by the new global land rush. After taking the course, students will have better knowledge of emerging research directions on Africa and will be equipped with sufficient research and practical skills to pursue independent studies beyond the classroom.

        "info": "In Coming to America, a 1988 film which blends humor and romance with some fairly pertinent observations, an African prince travels to Queens, NY, in search of a bride who will be both an equal and valued partner in life’s great adventure. In the thirty years since, the African immigrant story has become an intrinsic component of the booming canon of contemporary American immigrant literature, which includes such names as Edwidge Danticat, Jhumpa Lahiri, Junot Diaz, Chang-rae Lee, Gary Shteyngart, and others. This literary phenomenon mirrors trends identified in surveys and other similar data gathering activities. According to a 2009 study of the Migration Policy Institute, for instance, more than 75% of the foreign born African population in the United States has arrived since 1990. For these newcomers, Africa is not an imagined ancestral “motherland” impressed in collective memory. Nor is it a faraway continent of parental origin whose negative media portrayal at times foments a problematic identification. Africa is a lived space, a home left behind, the anchor of childhood memories and—all too frequently—a horizon that perpetually beckons. As for America, it is the idealized land of freedom, prosperity, and opportunity that sometimes gives more than it promised, but oftentimes disenchants. This course situates gender squarely within the interlocking contexts of dynamic, complex and ever-changing African and American landscapes. Over the course of the semester, we will read short stories, novellas, personal narratives and essays, interspersed with visual excerpts from selected films and other representations of immigration, migration and border crossing in contemporary African and American cultural landscapes.",

Given the multidisciplinary composition of the students and content in 8202, we build together to form a learning whole in a remote format. Central to our work is excavating the 500 year legacy of race thought and making into the contemporary period.",

        "info": "This course draws attention to the Indian Ocean as the new theatre of global economy and politics. Indeed, most historians generally consider Christopher Columbus?s 1492 landfall in the New World as the epoch-making moment in modern history. The undisputed and central place in history that North America ? and the larger Americas ? have come to occupy since that chance ?discovery? and the subsequent centuries of conquest, colonization, and imperial domination have made the Atlantic region the most studied area in the world. Long before European presence turned the Indian Ocean into a volatile space rife with tensions and competing interests, however, the Afrasian region was the locus of trade flows between Africa, the Middle East and Asia. By the time Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama reached the Swahili coast of East Africa in 1497 en route to India, expansive trade networks thrived in the area extending across the Sahara into the Atlantic Ocean in the West, and into the far East and beyond. Over the past two decades, Indian Ocean studies have witnessed an explosion driven by the incontestable fact that the region has today become the epicenter of global commerce, and a battleground for resource-based conflicts between waning, emerging superpowers, and their antagonists. AFRO 8802 deploys literary texts as reflective of ongoing critical engagement with the rise of the East as a major world center for technology, business, and increasingly, culture.",
