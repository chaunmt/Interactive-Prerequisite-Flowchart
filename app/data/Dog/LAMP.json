Therefore, the aim is to create a virtual Anatomic Pathology elective that will allow students to gain exposure to the field, make connections with pathologists, and provide opportunities for research and obtaining letters of recommendation. In addition, our goal is to also make this elective applicable to students going into other specialities (surgery, internal medicine, Ob/Gyn, among others) by individualizing the curriculum to focus on pathology that is specific to those specialities. Additionally, a secondary goal of this elective is to produce resources that will be utilized by future medical students and/or visiting medical students or international medical graduates. \n\n\n\n\n",
