In “How does blood and organ donation work?”, we will examine how our bodies can recognize and respond to foreign materials, how vaccines work, and who should have access to life saving tissue and organ transplants.  In “How do stress, diet and exercise affect health?” ,we will consider disparities in access to adequate nutrition, exposure to stress, and exercise, and how these affect our bodies and our mental health.  Lastly, in “How does a unique individual develop from a single cell”, we will examine how a single cell develops into a fully functional human being, and how similar processes lead to cancer. We will also consider the role of genes and hormones in human reproduction and the development of reproductive structures in embryos, while explicitly addressing the ethics of the distinctions between the concepts of sex characteristics, sex assigned at birth, and gender. We will learn how a cell can become cancerous, as well as how a cell develops into a fully functioning human being.

    "title": "Evolutionary Perspectives",
    "info": "Crops, humans, pests, and pathogens have evolved and continue to evolve, largely by natural selection (nonrandom differences in reproduction and survival among random genetic variants).  Weeds and insect pests readily evolve resistance to our control methods, from crop rotation to chemical pesticides.  Human pathogens evolve resistance to antibiotics.  Can we slow such harmful evolution?  Also, can the evolutionary history of crops help guide plant breeding?  Can our own evolutionary history suggest ways to improve health-care in humans?  In alternate weeks, students will discuss an assigned article or video and then find a related scientific journal article and explain one figure from the article. Grades will depend in part on courteous and insightful questions and comments among students. This course will be offered remotely via Zoom at a scheduled time. Personal interaction in this course is required through audio and video using Zoom. Short presentations by students will use “Share Screen”.",

You'll learn things that are strange but true and things that seem true but aren't. Near the end of the course, we'll use our new-found knowledge to make predictions about the future of biology research. This freshman seminar will have a clear focus on biology; you don't need to be a biology major, but you can expect to be finding and reading primary biological research papers. Note: some of the movies we'll be watching will be rated R.",

The University directed studies contract will be used to describe the training experience which could include attending lab meetings, reading and discussing research papers from the lab, learning basic lab and field techniques, assays, and approaches used by the research group, and learning to keep a lab or field notebook. The contract must be approved by the director of undergraduate studies (DUGS) for the major before the student is allowed to register. The contract includes a description of learning objectives for the course and how the assessment of learning will be conducted. Lab or field training can be led by graduate students or postdocs in the research group but one-on-one meetings with the PI should be included. The course is one credit and the student and PI agree that 45 hours of work will be done. There will be one group meeting per semester per major for all of the students enrolled in 2996 to discuss the research experience with the Director of Undergraduate Research for the major and a panel of more experienced undergraduate researchers. The goal of that meeting is community building and to introduce students to opportunities for further research experience. The grading option is S/N, similar to all directed studies/research courses in CBS. This course can be repeated, if it is done with a different mentor, for a total of two credits. One credit of this course can be counted as a degree requirement for each CBS major.",
