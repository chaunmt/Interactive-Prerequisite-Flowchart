Must be taken in addition to BIOL 1009 to fulfill prerequisites for allied health grad programs.\n\nThis course explores several interdisciplinary questions, each of which addresses biology through an ethical and societal lens.  In “What makes humans unique?”, we will consider the evolution of human traits, how the concept of race relates to human genetic diversity, and the fallibility of human memories.  In “How does blood and organ donation work?”, we will examine how our bodies can recognize and respond to foreign materials, how vaccines work, and who should have access to life saving tissue and organ transplants.  In “How do stress, diet and exercise affect health?” ,we will consider disparities in access to adequate nutrition, exposure to stress, and exercise, and how these affect our bodies and our mental health.  Lastly, in “How does a unique individual develop from a single cell”, we will examine how a single cell develops into a fully functional human being, and how similar processes lead to cancer. We will also consider the role of genes and hormones in human reproduction and the development of reproductive structures in embryos, while explicitly addressing the ethics of the distinctions between the concepts of sex characteristics, sex assigned at birth, and gender. We will learn how a cell can become cancerous, as well as how a cell develops into a fully functioning human being.  Additionally, we will consider the role of hormones in the development of male, female, and intersex organs, while being explicit about the differences between gender, sexual orientation, and sex assigned at birth.  \n\nIn lecture, instructors and teaching assistants will support students as they evaluate data and work through concepts in teams. Students will also dedicate significant time to the consideration of ethical questions in human biology, and work with teammates to organize and present a position on a policy related to an ethics question. In lab, students will further explore human anatomy and physiology, connecting structure and function through several dissections and activities. Students will read and share scientific papers, make observations, design experiments and analyze data.  Students will work in teams to complete a multi-week project on the physiology of stress. We will continue our exploration of ethics topics in lab, where we will discuss and apply ethics in human subjects research and research on non-human animals.  \n\nAbout ⅓ of the course grade will be based on four traditional lecture exams and a final lab exam. The remainder of the course grade is comprised of open notes quizzes, in class team assignments, individual assignments, and team projects. Course grading is based on mastery of concepts and skills, and students are encouraged to collaborate in understanding course material.",

Furthermore, with an ever increasing catalog of worlds detected around stars outside of our solar system, we are studying how to look for life on worlds beyond our solar system.\n\nThis course will address questions that are fundamental to Astrobiology, including: What is life? What are the requisites for life as we know it? Were these requisites present on other worlds in the past, or are they present today? How do we look for signs of past or present life on other worlds? To help address these questions, students will be exposed to basic principles of astronomy (star formation, planetary accretion), geology (planetary composition, geologic time, plate tectonics, preservation of biosignatures), chemistry (elements and reactions essential to life, chemical signatures life produces), and biology (metabolism, chemotrophy, phototrophy, biological innovation).\n\nStudents will leave this course with a deeper understanding of: how our solar system and planet formed; how life developed and evolved; planetary geology and geologic time; the types of life present in extreme environments; what conditions are necessary to make a world habitable; past, present, and future missions looking for life on other worlds; and the place of our planet in the universe.",

Weeds and insect pests readily evolve resistance to our control methods, from crop rotation to chemical pesticides.  Human pathogens evolve resistance to antibiotics.  Can we slow such harmful evolution?  Also, can the evolutionary history of crops help guide plant breeding?  Can our own evolutionary history suggest ways to improve health-care in humans?  In alternate weeks, students will discuss an assigned article or video and then find a related scientific journal article and explain one figure from the article. Grades will depend in part on courteous and insightful questions and comments among students. This course will be offered remotely via Zoom at a scheduled time. Personal interaction in this course is required through audio and video using Zoom. Short presentations by students will use “Share Screen”.",

        "info": "Directed Introduction to Research is an introduction to laboratory or field biological research for students with no prior experience, normally first- and second-year students. The University directed studies contract will be used to describe the training experience which could include attending lab meetings, reading and discussing research papers from the lab, learning basic lab and field techniques, assays, and approaches used by the research group, and learning to keep a lab or field notebook. The contract must be approved by the director of undergraduate studies (DUGS) for the major before the student is allowed to register. The contract includes a description of learning objectives for the course and how the assessment of learning will be conducted. Lab or field training can be led by graduate students or postdocs in the research group but one-on-one meetings with the PI should be included. The course is one credit and the student and PI agree that 45 hours of work will be done. There will be one group meeting per semester per major for all of the students enrolled in 2996 to discuss the research experience with the Director of Undergraduate Research for the major and a panel of more experienced undergraduate researchers. The goal of that meeting is community building and to introduce students to opportunities for further research experience. The grading option is S/N, similar to all directed studies/research courses in CBS. This course can be repeated, if it is done with a different mentor, for a total of two credits. One credit of this course can be counted as a degree requirement for each CBS major.",

As a student leader in CBS, you are in a peer leadership role that requires you to serve as a support, resource, connection, and bridge between your peers and their campus experience in the College of Biological Sciences. This course will complement basic job training and provide you with in-depth academic frameworks about the theory behind peer leadership, how it impacts the college student experience, why it works, and tools and practices that distinguish role modeling from exceptional peer leadership. This course will teach you the skills and techniques of being an effective peer leader, as well as how to support undergraduate students in their own transitions. Through college student development theory, peer leadership frameworks, reflective activities, group activities, and class discussion, we will explore how your personal experiences influence your understanding, practices, and effectiveness of peer leadership. The course also offers a learning laboratory for you to reflect and synthesize various aspects of your student leadership experience with a community of fellow leaders.",

The contract must be approved by the director of undergraduate studies (DUGS) for the major before the student is allowed to register. The contract includes a description of learning objectives for the course, how writing instruction will take place, a timeline for when student writing will be handed in and how it will be assessed, methodology to be used by the student, and how assessment of learning will be conducted by the mentor. Additional oversight is established for this course near the end of the semester the written output is submitted to the DUGS for the major. The DUGS is responsible to determine that the writing meets standards set by the CBS Education Policy Committee for quality of writing, appropriate citation of literature, well-constructed figures, tables, and legends (if present), appropriate use and interpretation of statistics (if present), conclusions that are supported by evidence, and well-formatted references.

        "info": "Writing Intensive Directed Research is an individual-study, laboratory or field research experience in which the student is mentored directly by a faculty member. This course is not for students starting out in research. It is intended for students who already have been working in the research group of the mentor and have developed an independent research project. In this course, the student will receive writing instruction through a writing support course (corresponding to 1 credit in addition to the credits of directed research time) that will meet weekly throughout the semester. The written output usually is in the form of a scientific paper describing the results of the student's project. Written output of the course must be revised during the semester and a schedule for writing, assessment, and revision needs to be in place at the beginning of the semester. The project needs to be explained in the campus Directed Research contract and the project and participation in the writing support course agreed on by both the student and faculty mentor. The contract must be approved by the Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUGS) for the major before the student is allowed to register. The contract includes a description of learning objectives for the course, agreement about how writing instruction will take place, confirmation of understanding of the timeline for when student writing will be handed in and how it will be assessed, methodology to be used by the student, and how assessment of learning will be conducted by the mentor.
