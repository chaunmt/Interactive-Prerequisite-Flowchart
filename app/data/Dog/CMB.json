The rapid development of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent for the COVID-19 pandemic, has helped to bring the pandemic under control. However, the misinformation about vaccines circulating in social media causes the anti-vaccine movement that threatens our public health and erodes the trust in biomedical sciences. In this course, we will:- Review basic knowledge of viruses and our immune system- Present the history and basic principles of vaccines - Introduce the representative vaccines developed for major viral diseases such as smallpox, polio, influenza, hepatitis B, human papillomavirus (HPV), Ebola, and COVID-19- Present the methods for vaccine development- Highlight the challenges and the innovative research in vaccine development - Discuss the benefits and risks of vaccinesThe overall goal of the course is to provide students with scientific knowledge of vaccines, foster students' interests in vaccine development, help students understand the basic concepts of virology and immunology, and prepare interested students for biomedical careers.Targeted students: graduate students, professional students, and senior undergraduate students who are interested in medical virology, immunology, and vaccines.","prereq":[]},{"code":"CMB 5300","subject":"CMB","id":"5300","title":"Prion Biology and Ecology","info":"Prions are among the most mysterious pathogens known to science. Few other disease agents have confounded physicians, biologists, and chemists to the extent that prions have. In this course, we will learn about the fundamental characteristics of infectious prions, including how they become infectious and the particular diseases they are associated with. The entire field of prion biology is young and, because of this, scientists are making exciting and important discoveries that add to our understanding of infectious proteins. To appreciate how the scientific community arrived at the current state of knowledge about prions, we will revisit and challenge some of the basic assumptions and orthodoxies of biology.","prereq":[]},{"code":"CMB 5303","subject":"CMB","id":"5303","title":"Comparative Models of Disease","info":"Disease processes in organ systems.
