In addition, the effects of increasingly sophisticated consumers, deregulation, technology changes, and expanding global services combine to create new challenges. To succeed, business executives must have the skills to lead their service managers to allocate resources, design effective processes, analyze and improve operating practices, and apply new technologies.
