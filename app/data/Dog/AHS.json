As the global world developed the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework, we have seen an increase in innovative strategies by countries to meet the 2030 goals, with France emerging as a leader in their efforts. The 2030 Sustainable Development Goals are framed by five categories: planet, people, prosperity, peace, and partnership.  France has made some innovative efforts to move the needle in each of these categories. For example, France is leading the way with food security, having introduced a new international strategy for food security, nutrition, and sustainable agriculture in October 2019.  From public health and healthcare systems to food safety and security, the extensive challenges require collaboration, coordination, and an interprofessional approach to be successful.\n\nAccording to writer Kim Ann Zimmerman, “The culture and underlying values in France are distinctly different from the US. The French believe in égalité, which means equality, and is part of the country's motto: \\\"Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité.\\\" Many say they place a higher importance on equality than liberty and fraternity, the other two words in the motto.”  We will explore how France’s history, culture, and underlying values affect health, health disparities and systems that influence health, healthcare and SDGs",

The teams will ask questions during site visits from their assigned SDG perspective in preparation for their final project on SDG’s in Ecuador. Site visits will include a visit to Colonial Quito and the Mitad del Mundo City Museum. Students will visit an urban and rural health center, the CINCA Agroecological Center, the San Clemente Pukyu Pamba project featuring an indigenous community where they will share a meal with the community. Students will also participate in an indigenous healing ceremony. Finally students will visit Pambilino, a Bosque Escuela, located in  the northwest of Ecuador near the community of Mashpi, a nature reserve of the Choco rainforest that has a 4 hectare permaculture farm in the North Occidental of Ecuador, nestled within the tropical foothills of Ecuador. They work to teach sustainable agroforestry techniques to those that want to learn on the Bosque-escuela.\n\nUpon returning to Minnesota, the students will participate in re-entry activities, present their final project, and have a final class debrief. Students will complete reflective journal entries throughout the semester and a final personal reflection on SGD’s in Ecuador compared and contrasted to Minnesota/USA.",
