    "info": "This course introduces students to the study of Health Humanities, a field that recognizes all the ways that the achievement of health and the practice of medicine are deeply rooted in the human experience of culture, power, history, ethics, as well as science. By applying the methods, concepts, and content from traditional humanities disciplines, the health humanities aim to improve health care by influencing its practitioners to refine and complexify students’ judgments based on a deep and complex understanding of illness, suffering, personhood, and related issues. We will explore all the ways that health and medicine are shaped not just by the clinical encounter, but by social, political, and cultural forces that make the experience of medicine, health, and care ever more important. \n\nThis course prioritizes BIG CONVERSATIONS about health, wellness, illness, care, and selfhood. It also prioritizes the need to develop effective skills of communication through in-class conversation and out-of-class writing. Additionally, this course recognizes the relationship between reading, searching for and interpreting evidence, and the clinical skills of diagnosis, patient advocacy, and humane medicine. In order to achieve these aims, we will be writing about the readings in formal and informal ways, always with an eye toward how we see agency, power, and humanity at work in the representation of medicine, illness, and health.

First, the course charts scientific constructs of sex, sexuality, and gender from the 19th to the 20th centuries.  Second, it explores how sex and gender became entangled with the so-called medical model, from the role of medical jurisprudence in leveraging a two-sex system for legal claims, sex and sexual disorder research in the early 20th century, the development of hormonal and surgical technologies to manipulate gender morphology in the later 20th century, and the impact of the medical model on medical access historically and in the present.  Finally, it identifies how queer and gender non-conforming people resisted, dodged, and mobilized changing scientific constructs, medical possibilities, and social opportunities.  This course combines lectures, discussions, and guided engagement with historical materials from several archival holdings, alongside with relevant readings from history and other disciplines.",

    "info": "What did the arts offer to medicine, and what did medicine offer to the arts in early modern time? How did the representation of the human being in poetry, drama, and figurative arts interplay with the new medical culture and practices at that time? This course will examine the dynamic interchange and engagement of Western Renaissance medical culture (before 1800) in relation to literary, visual and performing arts, approaching questions that cross disciplinary, geographical, and social boundaries.  Topics to be addressed include historical questions related to the intersection between the late European medieval university’s programs of medicine and arts, humanistic culture, and medical charlatanism. Moreover, we will focus on the ephemeral rituals of medical and performative practices and the visual culture in works of art and scientific illustrated treatises of life, death, and the afterlife. Finally, we will explore the embodiments in poetry and drama of illness and metaphor, gender conflicts, and medical, spiritual, and philosophical views of what it meant to be human. By exploring the value of humanistic study and medical ethical concerns in Renaissance humanism, students will understand the historical sources of a modern humanistic formation and be informed about the importance of ethics to citizenship, reconsidering the present vision of a humanistic education and imagining the future in the academic humanities and in our society. The course will culminate in a digital project involving students in the creation of a virtual exhibit on the course topics, by using the New Builder StoryMaps software proposed by DASH/U-Spatial. This is an introductory-level course.  ",

    "info": "HMED 3325 is an applied introduction to historical medical demography: the study of who is sick or injured, and the type of treatments given, and what happens after treatment. The records created by health care workers give us important insights into how medical practice has changed over time, making the quantitative study of historical medical records central to the History of Medicine. We often ask two fundamental questions when examining medical records: “how bad is it?” and “what works?” In other words, what are the consequences of illness or injury, and how effective are medical interventions? These are questions that continue to be asked today in contemporary health and medicine, so the analytical techniques you learn in this class can be applied to modern data. Unlike modern health records whose access is restricted to protect people’s privacy, surviving historical health records can be used quite easily. \n\nThis course will give you a hands-on experience in working with health data and researching the history of medicine. You will learn about different ways to collect and analyze data to effectively answer questions such as “what happened to people who were sick” and “did medical care help people?”—this is often called “causal inference”.  To do this effectively with historical medical records, we will read about how people in the past understood the illness or intervention we are studying. Understanding changes in the way people thought about illness and disease is another core part of the History of Medicine. To make sense of data, we need to know about how the people creating it understood the concepts they were measuring. This principle applies equally to modern data: effective data analysis requires us to understand what the numbers mean.\n\nThe class is structured to give you an overview of the research process from data collection to initial analyses. Working as a class we will collect a sample of historical health records from the University of Minnesota or Minnesota Historical Society archives giving you hands-on experience with archival research and designing social science databases. Through your readings for class and initial data exploration you will develop a research proposal, and then complete a small research project using the data we collected. At the completion of the course, you will have gained valuable experience in social science data analysis with real data and learned about how approaches to health, healing, and medicine have changed over time.",

Along the way we’ll evaluate the different methodological approaches used by scholars to study the history of disease, and we’ll examine the ways in which social values, cultural assumptions, and political interests have shaped how diseases have been defined, experienced, and treated, and we’ll consider the role that diseases have played in the shaping of health care institutions, policies, and practices. At the same time, we’ll examine the processes of medicalization and demedicalization; colonialism, post-colonialism, and the politics of state-building; the ecological understandings of disease, environmentalism, and the politics of place; and the increasingly visible role of the politicized consumer and patient activist in late 20th century health care politics.",
