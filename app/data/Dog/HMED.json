    "info": "hmed 3325 is an applied introduction to historical medical demography: the study of who is sick or injured, and the type of treatments given, and what happens after treatment. the records created by health care workers give us important insights into how medical practice has changed over time, making the quantitative study of historical medical records central to the history of medicine. we often ask two fundamental questions when examining medical records: “how bad is it?” and “what works?” in other words, what are the consequences of illness or injury, and how effective are medical interventions? these are questions that continue to be asked today in contemporary health and medicine, so the analytical techniques you learn in this class can be applied to modern data. unlike modern health records whose access is restricted to protect people’s privacy, surviving historical health records can be used quite easily. \n\nthis course will give you a hands-on experience in working with health data and researching the history of medicine. you will learn about different ways to collect and analyze data to effectively answer questions such as “what happened to people who were sick” and “did medical care help people?”—this is often called “causal inference”.  to do this effectively with historical medical records, we will read about how people in the past understood the illness or intervention we are studying. understanding changes in the way people thought about illness and disease is another core part of the history of medicine. to make sense of data, we need to know about how the people creating it understood the concepts they were measuring. this principle applies equally to modern data: effective data analysis requires us to understand what the numbers mean.\n\nthe class is structured to give you an overview of the research process from data collection to initial analyses. working as a class we will collect a sample of historical health records from the university of minnesota or minnesota historical society archives giving you hands-on experience with archival research and designing social science databases. through your readings for class and initial data exploration you will develop a research proposal, and then complete a small research project using the data we collected. at the completion of the course, you will have gained valuable experience in social science data analysis with real data and learned about how approaches to health, healing, and medicine have changed over time.",
