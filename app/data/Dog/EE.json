This involves understanding the parameters that are used to characterize antennas and how these effect system performance. An important aspect of the course is to provide the student with an understanding of the operating principles behind the most commonly used antennas. This is followed with exposure to basic design principles. These can be used to perform antenna design or can be used as starting points for design using an electromagnetic simulator.

    "info": "With the widespread use of cell phones autonomous vehicles, and the coming of the Internet of Things, there is an increasing need to understand wireless communications and radar sensors. A key component of these systems is the antenna. The purpose of this course is to help the student develop knowledge in the area of antennas. This involves understanding the parameters that are used to characterize antennas and how these effect system performance. An important aspect of the course is to provide the student with an understanding of the operating principles behind the most commonly used antennas. This is followed with exposure to basic design principles. These can be used to perform antenna design or can be used as starting points for design using an electromagnetic simulator. As part of the course, students will be exposed to simulator use through homework assignments, and possibly, course project work. \n\nprereq: EE 3601 or equivalent",

The other half of the course will be devoted to data-driven approximation of dynamical systems: i.e., given empirical data generated by a dynamical system, determine a mathematical representation for the underlying system dynamics.

Recent interest in learning methods is triggered by the widespread use of digital technology and availability of data. Unfortunately, developments in each field are seldom related to other fields. This course is concerned with estimation of predictive data-analytic models that are estimated using past data, but are used for prediction or decision making with new data. This course will first present general conceptual framework for learning predictive models from data, using Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) theoretical framework, and then discuss various methods developed in statistics, pattern recognition and machine learning. Course descriptions will emphasize methodological aspects of machine learning, rather than development of Â‘newÂ’ algorithms.\n\nprereq: CSE grad student or instr consent",

High power quality and availability are maintained in the bulk power\nsystem mainly by enforcing hierarchical operational practices, central decision making, and topological\nredundancy. However, this status quo is being challenged by changing generation, consumption\nand operational landscapes. Particularly, increased renewable generation, supply scarcity, the impetus\nto improve resiliency to extenuating weather impacts, and expanding electricity access call for the\ndevelopment of transformative architectural and operational paradigms. Recognizing these developments,\nthis course will present enabling modeling, analysis, and control methods that will be integral to\narchitect next-generation renewable-based power systems. These methods will be developed adopting\na bottom-up approach by leveraging recent theoretical advances in circuit theory, nonlinear systems,\ncomplex networks, and stochastic processes.",
