It also focuses on ways different social groups and communities, through creative acts of (un)dressing in the public sphere, create a complex relationship between structures of power and aesthetics. In addition to highlighting the significance of gender and material culture in Indian literature, this course traces the history of dress practices to offer new perspectives on class, caste, religion and nationalism. The readings will further highlight historical and political events where clothing and accessories become crucial sites for resisting established social order and registering collective protest. Texts will also be complemented with screenings of films to show the rich and complex intersection of dress practices with discourses of tradition and modernity.",

These themes will be debated in a range of spaces and contexts: the desert, the city, and the ocean as quintessential environments in times of great social and ecological upheavals; migration flows and refugee identities; the alternating banality and grotesqueness of war; and the formation of intimate, personal relationships.

        "info": "Japanese cultural history functions as an unusual suspect for our investigation of Japanese philosophy. In Japan studies, the term \\\"philosophy\\\" is typically thought to indicate Western-influenced philosophy in modern times (the late 19th century onward). Even when its pre-modern precursor is mentioned, discussion tends to focus on Shinto, Buddhism, and Confucianism as its matrices. Far beyond such realms, however, practitioners of artistic techniques--such as martial and performing arts--already engaged themselves in conceptualizing philosophical problems: \\\"What is nature?\\\" \\\"What is our existence?\\\" \\\"What is knowledge and how is it generated and transmitted?\\\" The list goes on, encompassing such topics as \\\"body\\\" and \\\"gender.\\\" This course explores this phenomenon. We will read Miyamoto Musashi's \\\"The Book of Five Rings,\\\" a famous treatise on swordsmanship written by a 17th-century samurai. Anyone interested in the topic and committed to learn is welcome. Aiming at Inclusive Design, it offers multiple options to enhance learning experiences.",

The objective of this course is to investigate and go beyond these debates about veiling and unveiling to uncover complex aesthetic and political acts of self-fashioning undertaken by Muslim writers, filmmakers, and artists as they engage with and re-define processes of Islamic piety and global modernity. Through innovative readings of film, literature, and popular culture from a range of geographical sites and historical periods, this course highlights the importance of clothing and adornment in the formation of gendered identities, religious beliefs, and nationalist politics. From the Turkish Fez to the Indian Sari, we will explore how dress practices stitch together structures of power, displays of masculinity, and questions of women's agency in different times and places. These explorations will be guided by an interest in identifying unconventional cultural sites for the staging and un-staging of \\\"Muslim dress\\\" and assessing the importance of fashion in stimulating gendered consumption and aesthetics.",

        "info": "Stories of the end of the world are nothing new; in classical times they ranged from the various versions of the judgment day in monotheistic religions to the periodic dissolution and regeneration of the universe conceived in Hinduism. While these narratives are still with us, many new visions of the end times have emerged in the context of the specific dangers and anxieties of modernity: nuclear war, famine from overpopulation, pandemics, take-over by robots or artificial intelligence, or just generalized existential despair caused by the loss of meaning and community grounded in tradition. In the 21st century, such fears and narratives have increasingly focused on various scenarios of how climate chaos already is speeding the world's sixth mass extinction of living species - meaning there are countless mini-apocalypses happening all around us from the perspective of the Earth's biosphere as a whole - while also threatening the possible extinction of our own species.\n\nThis course will explore narratives of extinction and apocalypse from a global, comparative perspective. Each week we will watch a  film, often a challenging, experimental one - including films from both East and West - and we will accompany them with diverse types of readings from dystopic sci-fi stories to nonfiction bestsellers to academic studies of how the threat of extinction plays out in other primate species besides humans. We will ask how such narratives articulate specific fears and anxieties and discuss whether and how they make a cultural intervention that could actually change human behavior to make extinction less (or more) likely. What exactly does it mean to envision the extinction of our species or the collapse of human society, and why do people seek out such narratives and presumably derive some useful ideas from them?",

        "info": "\\\"Membership\\\" is a peculiar thing. While the matter is certainly an issue of critical moment here and now, and to an intense degree at that, at no place nor time in human history is it totally irrelevant. For, just as with many animate beings, humans have lived in a way in which the action of \\\"grouping\\\" is omnipresent. On the level of both theory and practice, the notions and actions of classification of people into categories have been deeply ingrained in how many civilizations have flourished across time and space. The criteria of such classification are not only myriad but also diverse with no single governing principle (e.g., ancestry, birthplace, race and ethnicity, sex and gender, sexuality, social standing such as class and rank, religion, and so on and so forth). Groups thus formed--be they country, nations, clans, circles, communities, men, women, and the like--are also heavily varied and respective definitions and expectations of \\\"members,\\\" and \\\"non members\\\" for that matter, are wide-ranging. \n\nUsing a specific case study from performing arts in Japan (described below), this seminar helps introduce fresh\\\"man\\\" students at the U to critical thinking in the humanities, by encouraging them to grapple with such a significant and formidable topic as membership, which will provide them with a methodological tool and contemplation ability that promises to be useful throughout (and hopefully beyond) their education at the U. Two key elements of such training are \\\"intersection-ness\\\" and \\\"self reflectiveness.\\\" Relying on \\\"intersectionality\\\" (i.e., a well-known concept established in the context of black feminism signifying a hub of various interlocking intersections in a system), the former is to remind students of the aforementioned diverse nature of grouping. The latter is a caution that the seminar is not merely for us to gather information about the performing arts in question, but to critically contemplate the phenomenon with the understanding that we are not any pure, perfect, unrelated observer with an imaginary objective perspective. To these purposes, the seminar utilizes two pedagogical methods: scaffolding (small multiple tasks to achieve a semester-long project) and group activities for stimulation and mutual support. \n\nThe performing arts in Japan that the seminar uses as a case study is gidayû music. The audio component of the four-century-old puppet theater in Japan now known as bunraku, gidayû is usually if not always conducted by two musicians: string-music played by an instrumentalist and the entire lines of all characters on stage narrated solo by a single chanter, who also sings descriptive recitation. Bunraku is an all-male theater, and gidayû all-male theatrical vocal-music. Female performers have long been playing gidayû as stand-alone music, however, almost always under men's names and sometimes in men's clothing. In premodern times (through 1867), when females' were prohibited from participating in performing arts since 1629-proclamations, female gidayû players frequently endured such drastic ordeals as bans, property-confiscation, and incarceration imposed by samurai authorities. In modern times (from 1868 to date), these female performers were no longer subject to such physically violent sentence, but epistemological turmoil they faced was no less radical. The seminar will pay attention to these female musicians. In addition, since the instructor knows some contemporary female gidayû musicians in person, the seminar might have an opportunity to learn their stories from themselves, possibly using such technology as Zoom (contingent).",

        "info": "An internationally renowned piece, The Tale of Genji was produced in the Classical Era in Japan when high-ranking ladies-in-waiting produced literary arts in volumes. It was during the same time when a male middle-class aristocrat, who wrote a diary literature assuming a female identity, is said to have established the definition of Japanese poetry by associating it with femininity. When it comes to theater, all four classical theaters in Japan--noh, kyogen, kabuki, and bunraku-puppet theaters--have been \\\"all-male\\\" theaters. Japanese theater would later see the birth of an all-female revue, Takarazuka. This seminar will utilize these gender-loaded cultural traditions as the venue of our contemplating the mechanisms of gendering: How we do genders. If gender does not merely mirror biology, as the greatly criticized essentialism in gender studies revealed, and if gender is not simply bestowed upon us by society or culture, as the debunked constructionism in the said context conceded, then, how have humans done genders diversely but imperatively, and precariously yet creatively?",

Given the nature of conflict that always goes above and beyond the question of nation-state, this course will also discuss its amplification to the question of migration, refugee crisis, displacement, and multi-generational trauma among diasporic subjects. Located at the intersection of conflict, peace, and protest, this course not only introduces students to historical processes and complexities of these conflicts—both from the national and international points of view—but also challenges students to question the potentials of graphic novels in mediating these histories and discourses around human rights for readers. Finally, this class explores ways in which we can engage with each other via our shared history and vulnerability, and questions whether peace and resolution promised to our generation via the discourse of human rights are, or will ever be, attainable.",

While reflecting cultural transformations across history, these examples manifest a consistent poetics of emptiness, due to the genre's thematic preoccupation with resistance and transcendence, as well as its roots in Confucian-Daoist-Buddhist philosophies. In these regards, the martial arts genre, other than being a pop culture phenomenon, offers a meaningful gateway toward rediscovering the Chinese tradition's cosmopolitan potentials.",

For centuries, literature has remained an important site for the expression of Islamic identity and its interaction with the larger history of the subcontinent. Muslim writers have traversed diverse domains of human experience through multiple genres: while poetry has been a widely celebrated genre for the expression of private love, drama has emerged as a crucial site for public politics and activism. In this course, students will read texts that have circulated across South Asia and interpret them in relation to enduring questions about power, justice, identity, community and love (both human and divine) in Islam. Reading a wide array of works from diverse temporal and spatial locations, this course examines how the aesthetic and discursive world of South Asia provides a terrain on which the Islamic \\\"socius\\\" of the region has come to define itself in a unique manner. In addition, we also investigate how these literary cultures-at different historical junctures-articulated a secular ethos to define Hindu-Muslim relations in the subcontinent. We further discuss questions of genres-epic, romance, drama, novel and lyric-as a way of thinking about the circulation of literary forms across languages, cultures and national spaces in the past and the present.

The course is attentive to the impact of historical processes on cinema as well as to how film and media process historical events—colonialism, militarism, religious conflict, ideological wars, economic turmoil. The course is guided by three different problematics: the arrival of cinema as an imported technology that coincided with and was arguably contingent upon the European colonial presence in the region; the ideological conflicts of the Cold War, anti-Communist sentiments; and the emergence of national film industries vis-à-vis independent cinema in the contemporary time. The latter sees cinema as a recuperative means, on the one hand, from political trauma and, on the other hand, from the ongoing human rights crises and the decline of democracy in the region. ",

Students learn how to interpret each region’s textiles and embroideries and how they represent embroidered language and identities. Although there will be a central focus on Asia, this class also focuses on an international Hmong identity which includes Europe, Australia, USA, and other countries of the Hmong diasporic journey. The class analyzes the role textiles play in today’s international Hmong population, transformation, advancement, and commodification.

Following a survey of classic texts and contexts, we will ask why modern authors summon demons and resurrect ghosts, and what political and cultural work these unruly beings are called to perform. More specifically, we will explore the manner in which jinn are latched onto modern debates on personal and collective trauma, memory, madness, relations between East and West (or North and South), political and state violence, gender relations and hierarchies, and virtual realities.",

Ultimately, this leads us to a number of questions: what is the relationship between history/politics and art? Can artistic texts transcend the historical and political contexts in which they are produced?  How has artistic production functioned within the context of Palestinian statelessness, exile, and anti-colonial struggle?

Internationally renowned for its artistic, thematic, and narrative prowess, post-revolutionary Iranian cinema is unique in its ability to capture the aspirations, struggles, and triumphs of ordinary Iranians as they manage life in the Islamic Republic. In moving beyond stereotypical images presented by mass media, modern Iranian cinema provides a medium for us to delve into the complex makeup of issues such as religion, gender, class, and politics in Iran today. How does Iranian cinema reflect Iran's culture, society and politics? What role does Iranian cinema play in shaping Iran's national identity? What new insights does Iranian cinema shed onto the interests, subjectivities, and desires of Iranians themselves? Throughout this course, we will attempt to answer these questions by viewing a number of masterpieces of Iranian cinema and reading related social, historical, and political analyses. By engaging in an exploration of daily life in Iran through film, we will gain a more nuanced understanding of Iran's modern landscape and the diversity of opinions and experiences that it constitutes. This course will also serve as an introduction to Iranian history, especially following the 1979 revolution. By examining how Iranian cinema is intimately linked with this history, students will gain a better understanding of the significant role that cinema has played in shaping Iran today.",

Crucially, this course also examines the manner in which this re/production of the “Arab World/Subject” is integral to the construction of western identity itself – serving as a foil to western self-conceptualization. \n\nThe concept of orientalism was introduced into western scholarship by Edward Said through his seminal 1978 work, Orientalism, often credited as a foundational text in the field of postcolonial studies. In the first part of the course, we will closely read Orientalism and some of the influential critical engagements with Said’s book. We will also discuss how orientalist discourse has been subsumed under the debates on the “Clash of Civilizations” and “The War on Terror” in the 21st century. The second part of the course will look at orientalist representations in a variety of mediums, from literature and visual art to video games. In the final part of the course, we will try to “inventory the traces” of Orientalism on the Oriental subject, or examine the manner Arab artists and writers have engaged with orientalism’s legacies. \n",

In addition to reading the writings of Muslim holy men (and sometimes women) from Turkey to China and beyond, we will also consider the role of Islamic mysticism in Muslim societies, and how it influenced people at various levels of society.

Twenty years later, in The Great Derangement, he concluded that our prevalent narrative forms are inadequate to narrate the slow catastrophe of climate change, simply because they are so implicated, even complicit, in the extractive logics of petromodernity. \n\nThis course explores our contemporary modernity of oil dependence through critical engagement with Middle Eastern cultural production. It postulates that to think about oil is not solely to think about derricks or spectacular spills or barrel prices, but about the basic narratives, fictions, and ideologies that underline our daily lives; that reading fictions (conceived broadly) is both a method and resource to map and critique ways in which the world's resources are unevenly produced, extracted, and exploited on a global-local scale; and that humanistic inquiry can challenge the common assumption that existing energy systems are inevitably necessary in modern life. Throughout the semester, the students will engage in critical readings of novels, films, and visual art that emerge from and react to the networked reality of an oil-addicted world. They will critically analyze the narrative forms and visual vocabularies through which the petro-industry has been depicted, as well as learn about the violent history of oil extraction and its environmental effects. Finally, they will consider how creative works allow us to imagine and promote alternative and more sustainable energy futures.",

Why were people willing to set themselves on fire to protest against having to speak Hindi in southern India, and willing to fight wars to defend it in the north? How was Hebrew, which had been a dead language for almost 2000 years, revived as a modern spoken language? What are the politics of imposing a single language, Mandarin, on an incredibly diverse population of 1.3 billion people in China? This seminar explores the politics of language across Asia through case studies in parts of the Middle East, South Asia, and East Asia. It pairs literary and historical case studies with different theoretical frameworks for the study of language politics, and explores how language has been central to political and historical phenomena from European and Japanese colonialism to state formation to anti-colonial struggles and revolutionary movements. Students will therefore gain specific knowledge about how language politics have played out historically and presently in different parts of Asia, as well as developing theoretical and analytical skills for thinking critically about language in general.\nPlease print out readings for note taking and for use in class discussion. All readings will be in English translation and no prior linguistic or historical knowledge is required for this class.",

In the 1930s, the arrival of sound in cinema provided a space for phonographic modernity to be expressed through film. In the Peoples Republic, the productive interplay between traditional art forms and cinema entered a new era, culminating in the cinematic adaptations of the model plays of the Cultural Revolution. Finally, recent years have seen the explosive growth of digital cinema, computer animation, internet culture, and gaming communities.",

Certain consistencies of style and theme spread to various sites across histories and geographies, yet much variation also was evident and will be explored in this class. Rejecting the dismissal of socialist realism as mere propaganda, we will take seriously its theorization and its aesthetic innovations, as well as its relationships with classical Hollywood narration, melodrama, and the psychoanalytic concept of sublimation. Through an examination of socialist realism?s variations and limits, we will grapple with larger questions of modernity, authority, and the function of art in modern societies.",

No less importantly, we inquire into theoretical implications of subject matter, such as citationality, gender construction, and the like. Furthermore, this course attends to what is usually marginalized and overlooked in kabuki historiography: koshibai (unlicensed small troupes of kabuki); onna yakusha (women kabuki actors who mastered the acting techniques established by male kabuki actors--including the technique of female impersonation). Open to anyone with an interest, no previous knowledge of Japanese studies, theater studies, or Japanese is required. All of the readings will be available in English.

This class will address these questions through a survey of the political, intellectual, social, and cultural aspects of Arab modernity. We will examine how Arab thinkers of the late 19th and early 20th century produced new genres, identities, and communal affiliations to narrate their experience of modernity, which they often coded as “the encounter with the West.” Our readings, all in English translation, will cover the first confrontations (and love affairs) with European powers, the self-professed urgency of projects of reforming language, literature, and cultural institutions, the growing schism between religious and secular thought, and the attempts to articulate indigenous alternatives to Western-style modernity.

Twenty years later, in The Great Derangement, he concluded that our prevalent narrative forms are inadequate to narrate the slow catastrophe of climate change, simply because they are so implicated, even complicit, in the extractive logics of petromodernity. \n\nThis course explores our contemporary modernity of oil dependence through critical engagement with Middle Eastern cultural production. It postulates that to think about oil is not solely to think about derricks or spectacular spills or barrel prices, but about the basic narratives, fictions, and ideologies that underline our daily lives; that reading fictions (conceived broadly) is both a method and resource to map and critique ways in which the world's resources are unevenly produced, extracted, and exploited on a global-local scale; and that humanistic inquiry can challenge the common assumption that existing energy systems are inevitably necessary in modern life. Throughout the semester, the students will engage in critical readings of novels, films, and visual art that emerge from and react to the networked reality of an oil-addicted world. They will critically analyze the narrative forms and visual vocabularies through which the petro-industry has been depicted, as well as learn about the violent history of oil extraction and its environmental effects. Finally, they will consider how creative works allow us to imagine and promote alternative and more sustainable energy futures.",

        "info": "This course aims to provide critical and theoretical foundations for incoming graduate students in Asian Literatures, Cultures, and Media program, while also addressing broader questions that would be of interest to students in other departments in the Humanities and Social Sciences. Our project will be to generate discussion about the theoretical and political complexities of studying Asia and the Middle East from a cross-cultural and transnational perspective, taking account of several inter-related questions at the heart of the work of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies. Beginning with Edward Said’s critique of orientalism as our point of departure, we will take up a range of questions revolving around debates over historiography (e.g., capitalism and the formations of race and gender, nationalism and imperialism, etc.) and the relationship between cultural studies and political-economy (e.g., the political unconscious, national allegory, translation and translingual practice, ethnographic gaze, etc.) with a particular attention to the complications posed by taking “Asia” as the object of intellectual inquiry in any such analysis. Our discussions will consider key problematics in cultural theory, the uses of such theory in the Asian context and some of the issues thereby raised, and critical interventions by scholars of Asia.",
