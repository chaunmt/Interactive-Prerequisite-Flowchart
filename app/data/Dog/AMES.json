    "prereqInfo": "this course will explore narratives of extinction and apocalypse from a global, comparative perspective. each week we will watch a  film, often a challenging, experimental one - including films from both east and west - and we will accompany them with diverse types of readings from dystopic sci-fi stories to nonfiction bestsellers to academic studies of how the threat of extinction plays out in other primate species besides humans. we will ask how such narratives articulate specific fears and anxieties and discuss whether and how they make a cultural intervention that could actually change human behavior to make extinction less (or more) likely. what exactly does it mean to envision the extinction of our species or the collapse of human society, and why do people seek out such narratives and presumably derive some useful ideas from them?",

",
