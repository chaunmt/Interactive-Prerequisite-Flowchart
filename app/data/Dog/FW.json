We cover the basics of fisheries science (habitats, ecology, and population dynamics) and management (e.g., goals, tools, implementation, and assessment) with an emphasis on human intervention and regulation. We first cover management approaches and planning, the development of an information base, and the identification of problems. We then provide a brief overview of applied limnology, fish ecology, and population dynamics, followed by approaches to manage fishery populations and habitats in freshwater and marine systems along with methods to assess management outcomes. Throughout, we demonstrate applications to specific fisheries and habitats. This is primarily a lecture-based course that also integrates field trips, group discussions, and activities.

How can we make systematic decisions to get the biggest bang for our conservation buck? To address these questions, this course will cover key topics and concepts in conservation planning and provide exposure and hands-on experience with techniques for conservation plans and decisions. We will cover topics ranging from protected areas, restoration, ecosystem services, and climate change to structured decision-making, adaptive management, and return on investment. The course has a lecture and in-class computer lab component. This course will present structured approaches to problem-solving and decision-making from a conservation perspective, and students will leave with tools for structuring and solving complex environmental problems.
