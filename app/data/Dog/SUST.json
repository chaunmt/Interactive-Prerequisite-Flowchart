The program explores how an emerging international ecotourism sector affects the livelihoods and culture of remote ethnic communities at the edge of the Tibetan plateau. The ecology of the communities the class will visit, which are among the most biodiverse in the world, will be a focus for the program. Spectacular snow-capped mountains, alpine meadows, river gorges and grasslands are present. The climate is moderate and the air is clean in this region of China. A trek to a village not accessible by road and a homestay with a Tibetan farm family will be highlights for students in the course. ",
