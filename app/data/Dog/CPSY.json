Although students who complete this course become familiar with major theoretical and applied approaches to clinical interventions and psychotherapy practice, the focus is not on gaining mastery in any particular psychotherapy approach. Instead, this course focuses on developing an understanding of fundamental principles of clinical interventions, therapeutic techniques, and psychotherapy practice, including the nature and underlying mechanisms of therapeutic change, research methods for evaluating the efficacy and effectiveness of clinical interventions and psychotherapy at the group and individual levels, a critical evaluation of contemporary psychotherapy approaches, and limitations in the current evidence base. In addition to readings and in-class discussions, students participate in in-person, group applications of basic clinical skills, including activities to help prepare them for beginning psychotherapy practice. This course thus provides a framework for understanding and applying the theories, principles, and methods of effective clinical interventions for students who will subsequently train in intervention-focused, in-person psychotherapy practica.
