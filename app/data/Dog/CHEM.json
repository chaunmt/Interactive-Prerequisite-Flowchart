At its core, the scientific method is based on the formulation and testing of hypotheses based on observations and measurements; but how do we “see” in science? Cells are too small to see with the naked eye, proteins and molecules are too small to be observed even with the most powerful microscopes. So how do scientists know a process is happening and what that process is? Many powerful techniques have been developed over the years to help scientists observe the systems of interest, each type of observation providing specific data. The data, however, are often subject to interpretation. We will discuss different imaging and characterization techniques widely used in Chemistry, Biology, Biochemistry, and Material Science. Classes will include field trips to several imaging and characterization facilities hosted by various Departments and Colleges on the Twin Cities campus and guest lectures by experts in specific techniques.\n",

Recognizing that the future is humanity’s hands, the United Nations launched an agenda called, “Transforming our world: 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”. This agenda focuses 17 Sustainable Development Goals that stimulate action for people, planet, prosperity, peace, and partnerships. (Check out: sdgs.un.org/goals)\n \nIn this seminar we will be discussing on what these sustainable goals mean to us as individuals and members of our communities. We will be speaking with experts on sustainability, we will brainstorm about solutions that may impact our communities and beyond. We will have fun working together on a project that highlights how our education and training could align with one or more of these goals. \n",
