Traditionally, grief is separated from laughter by using the twin categories of comic and tragic. But even in drama or literature, grief is not utterly desperate and laughter is not always funny. This last paradox -that laughter need not be comic- serves as a basic axiom for our course, which will study not just the laughter presented in literature but historical (e.g., classical and medieval) examples. Instead of focusing on contradictory generic theories, this course examines laughter in specific dramatic, narrative and historical works from ancient Greece and Rome down through the medieval and modern eras. This course will show students how to bring a historical perspective to bear on the philosophical question, \\\"What is laughter?\\\" As modern readers, they will learn that the best way for us to study a past culture is to start with critical thinking about our own.",

As a result, Queer directors and writers sometimes “speak” in a liberatory way to particular oppressed/silenced groups on the level of coded content, but if the content is consumed out of context of the code, the experience of a film may be contradictory, even offensive.

In this course, we will study adaptations of the legend in order to understand how literary writers and their readers remade the story to fit specific, historical circumstances. The course will pay particular attention to two related aspects of the legend. The first is the way that stories about Arthur emphasize the importance of personal integrity as a shaping force of history. The second is the relationship between personal responsibility and communal or civic order. We will see how these ideas are reshaped by writers in various times and places (ranging from early medieval Wales and England to twenty-first-century America). We will think comparatively about these times and places by paying close attention to the literary traditions and forms that are employed by writers who remake the story of Arthur.",

This recommended learning framework can engage your role as a citizen, broaden the impact of your education, and help you explore potential professional interests.

The aim of the course is to provide a challenging and useful introduction to the enormous cultural shifts of the decade that resonate in the present moment and that make Wilde a continuing figure of great cultural debate and significance.",

Nonetheless, there is something to be said for browsing stacks, handling physical books, and exploring the actual spaces of libraries. Physical libraries and books allow for a different way of experiencing knowledge and enable surprising discoveries – discoveries about our topics of interest, as well as about what libraries might be good for and what knowing might mean. In this seminar we will visit local libraries – UMN libraries, Hennepin County Libraries, museum libraries – and read about the world history of libraries – from Ancient Alexandria through modern national collections, such as the British Library and the Library of Congress. Students will write three short reports from their visits to local libraries, and a short research paper on a historical library of their choice. ",

Whether in totalitarian states in which liberal freedoms no longer exist or after the decimation of the natural environment, society and its infrastructures, the idea that we are headed to ruin is an entertaining prospect (in that it is suffused into so much of our entertainment-oriented media). This course analyzes these dystopian and post-apocalyptic representations in relationship to the “catastrophes” impacting various marginalized groups in the present, problematizing the futuristic settings of the world’s end. This course considers the modes of thought that have led and are leading to our destruction(s) and that drive our consumption of these pessimistic imaginings of the future. Together we will connect the apocalypses/dystopias that we turn away from and disavow in the present, those we pave the way for in the future, and those that we pay good money to watch. Finally, we will consider how marginalized subjects have imagined and theorized other modes of political and social organization within their apocalyptic presents and what, if anything, we can do about these present and potentially future catastrophes. Readings may include include comics and films from Marvel and D.C., and novels and short stories by N.K. Jemisin, P.D. James Alexis, Pauline Gumbs, and Octavia Butler. ",

Do they derive from something inherent in human nature, the actions and ideologies of particular nations, or the competitive nature of the international political system?  What logics govern the proliferation of ever deadlier weaponry?  Can wars be managed?  Will the world ever really know peace?  How did major writers, artists, composers, political thinkers, and opinion shapers address these questions over the violent course of the twentieth century? In terms of methodology, this course falls somewhere on the disciplinary boundaries between history, international relations theory, and literary studies. Our readings will include Kenneth Waltz’s seminal work of IR theory, Man, the State, and War; the World War I poets Rupert Brooke, Siegfried Sassoon, Wilfred Owen, and Margaret Postgate Cole; Robert Grave’s unforgettable war memoir, Goodbye to All That; Patrick Hamilton's Slaves of Solitude; Evelyn Waugh’s Put Out More Flags; Elizabeth Bowen’s The Demon Lover and Other Stories; Svetlana’s Alexievitch’s The Unwomanly Face of War; John Hersey’s Hiroshima; and Walter J. Miller’s A Canticle for Liebowitz.

Class discussions will focus on the poems that most fascinate class members. What bothered or thrilled you? How did the poet make you feel this way with that phrase?

    "info": "Alternate histories have long been a popular subgenre of science fiction. Alternate historical novels are set in the \\\"real\\\" world, but imagine the real world to be shaped by different historical outcomes and events. Typically, they are set in a fictional historical timeline prompted by \\\"what if\\\" questions: what if Nazi Germany and Japan had won World War II? What if John Brown's raid at Harper's Ferry had succeeded? Authors use alternate historical settings to cast new perspectives on factual history, as well as to make claims about the nature of history, historical memory, historical records, and historical consciousness themselves. While such works tend to be seen as genre fiction, major literary writers like Philip Roth and Michael Chabon have also penned their own alternate histories. In addition, political figures as diverse as Winston Chamberlain and Newt Gingrich have speculated about alternate historical timelines. Not surprisingly, alternate histories tend to bring up questions about historical knowledge itself. Thinkers have long debated this subject, asking questions like: how do we know what we \\\"know\\\" about the past? How does the act of constructing non-fictional narratives of the past shape or influence our perception of past events? And what or who makes historical change happen; Great individuals? Ideological conflicts and influential ideas? Economic changes? In this course, we'll read a selection of alternate historical fiction, as well as examine some influential theories of history as an object of study and analysis. We'll ask what kinds of cultural, social, and political values motivate writers to construct hypothetical historical realities. Finally, you will experiment with writing your own alternate historical short fiction or essay, crafting a fictional or non-fictional narrative set in/about an alternate historical timeline, and justifying your own decisions in reimagining the past.",

Scores of groups, some with hundreds of local chapters, are devoted to removing books from libraries, classrooms, and bookstores. Police reports have been filed against dozens of local librarians. Politicians have asked school districts to report on long lists of titles and discussed exposing teachers and staff to felony charges if they provide \\\"inappropriate\\\" books to students. In this seminar, we'll ask what makes some books so dangerous that people would try this hard to keep them from us. We'll read the most frequently banned and challenged books in the U.S. today, as well as books that were considered unsuitable for adults in the past. We'll look at books that are likely to make you uncomfortable.

Can we distinguish religion from culture, and what are the implications when we try? Why is it frequently asked whether Saul Bellow was \\\"really\\\" a Jewish writer, but it is impossible to read Philip Roth as anything other than that? How does Grace Paley's \\\"Jewishness\\\" come through even when she is writing about non-Jewish characters? We will address these issues and others as we explore the literature growing out of the Jewish immigrant experience in America, as well as the literature by Jewish writers more firmly, though still sometimes anxiously, rooted in American soil. In this course we will engage in a highly contextualized and historicized study of Jewish American literature from the 19th century to today.  We will discover in these texts how inherited Jewish culture and literary imaginings, developed over centuries of interaction between Jewish communities and the \\\"outside world,\\\" get reexamined, questioned, rejected, reimagined, reintegrated, and transformed within the crucible of American experience. The discussions that ensue will also provide a framework for engaging with the creative energies and cultural productivity of more recent immigrant communities in the United States and beyond. Immigration and the experience of immigrant communities continues to be at the forefront of American consciousness, as immigrants work to create new meanings and new narratives for their lives, and as those who immigrated before them provide contested meanings for the impact of immigration on their own narratives. This course, though grounded in Jewish narratives, will therefore provide students with an expanded vocabulary and perspective for engaging in this central and very current debate within the American experience.

This course explores the history of the Mediterranean with particular emphasis on the literatures it has produced over the last three millennia. As the protagonists of these epic poems, religious texts, and novels travel from one shore to another, they experience the Mediterranean as a place of violence, cultural accommodation, hope, ethnic and linguistic bewilderment, and endless moral challenge. This course will place as much emphasis on the region's history as its cultural productions. With that in mind, reading may include David Abulafia's The Great Sea in addition to The Odyssey, The Aeneid, the biblical books of Joshua and Acts, Tasso's Gerusalemme Liberata (an epic set during the first crusade), Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice and Antony and Cleopatra, Flaubert's Salammbo, Akli Tadjer's Les ANI du Tassali, A.b.

Spy Fi is concerned with threats to the state--Nazis, Russians, rogue states, terrorist masterminds, and moles here at home.  In contrast to British Spy Fi, famously represented by James Bond, the MI6 agent who plied his trade in sophisticated or exotic settings, American novels tend to feature cowboy protagonists with military or sports backgrounds and a penchant for spectacular violence.  In this course, we will read novels and analyze the development of sub-genres, protagonists, plots, settings, and language; the shifting roles of female characters; the paranoiac ideologies that hover beneath the narratives or pop to the surface; and the target audiences and sales.",

    "info": "America's relationship with food and eating has changed profoundly over the last fifty years. At the heart of this revolution was a group of charismatic personalities who through writing and television brought first European and then global sensibilities to the American table. They persuaded Americans that food and cooking were not just about nutrition but also forms of pleasure, entertainment, and art; ways of exploring other cultures; and means of declaring, discovering, or creating identity. Their work would eventually transform the American landscape, helping give rise to the organic movement, farmers markets, locavorism, and American cuisine, as well as celebrity chefs, the Food Network, and restaurant reality television. In the meantime, the environmental movement was sending its own shockwaves through American consciousness of food production and consumption. The joining together of these movements--culinary and environmental--has brought a new ethical dimension to the subject that is now at the forefront of current concerns about American food. Insofar as we eat, we necessarily make choices that have profound implications for our health, our communities, the environment, and those who work in the food industry, broadly defined. This class will trace the American food revolution with the intent of understanding how our current system came to be and thinking through the ethical implications of our daily actions. We will read classic literature from the rise of the movement, in varying degrees instructional, personal and documentary, while viewing some seminal television moments for the food culture we now know. We will give particular attention to recent work that focuses on the personal and environmental ethics of food.",

    "info": "Salem is what typically comes to mind when we think of witchcraft, and our class will indeed focus on the 1692 trials and their aftermath. But we will also range more broadly, exploring witchcraft in the early Atlantic world by paying special attention to the roles played by magic and possession. A fundamental aspect of this course, moreover, is its distinction as a literary one. This is not a class about how witchcraft, possession, and magic “change over time” but a class about their representations. From the beginning, we will be deeply attentive to the fact that each and every “evidence” of witchcraft, possession, or magic is an act of representation in the first place. As literary historians, we will move\nfrom Europe to the Americas, looking at how invocations and accusations of witchcraft traveled between the 16th and late-18th centuries. More importantly, as literary critics we will trace and examine depictions of witchcraft and the idea of the witch across four interrelated socio-historical contexts: the Protestant Reformation in 16th-century Europe; slave medicine and obeah in the Caribbean; possession and the “invisible world” in Puritan Massachusetts; and revivalism in 18th-century New England. By the end of this course, you will be able to: interpret literary texts and understand the literary aspects of historical documents; place literature in relation to its historical and cultural contexts; locate and evaluate relevant scholarship and cultural commentary; and formulate and communicate a focused and stylistically appropriate that supports its claims with textual evidence, especially through close and critical reading.\n",

In this class, we will look at the variety and complexity of answers given to that question, from sunny nostalgia, to valorization of the individual, valorization of the team, depictions of the dark side of the American dream, critiques of racial relations, and an approach that strives to eliminate both the poetry and the hand-wringing with a long hard look at numbers and facts. In this journey, we will study and participate in a number of ways that literature teaches us to understand society and ourselves. We will examine the idea of American pastoral and anti-pastoral. We will use the great variety of ways to write about baseball as a platform to consider how we come to know and believe. Throughout the course, we will examine the way baseball writing treats race and gender. We will also look at excerpts of films made from some of the texts. Comparing the films to the literature allows us to discuss what representations of America seem more palatable to producers aiming for a larger audience than literature usually reaches and to highlight ways writing makes arguments that films cannot.",

    "prereqInfo": "Knights and pilgrims appear as central figures in a wide range of literary works.  Some of the texts are humorous, like Chaucer's Canterbury Tales in which pilgrims, from social classes ranging from knights to tradespeople, travel together and tell stories.  Some are exciting and emotional, like Malory's retelling of stories about King Arthur and his knights.  Others provide us with explorations of longing for change:  in these works people search for new kinds of social and spiritual life such as Margery Kempe's autobiographical account of her experiences as a pilgrim to Rome and the Holy Land.  Still others, such as Langland's Piers Plowman, which incorporates pilgrimage and chivalric quest, critique and explode static ideas about social problems such as poverty and hunger.  Some draw our attention to the dangers and turmoil involved in love and relationships, such as Marie de France's courtly, aristocratic lays:  Marie's knights and ladies take up the search for love and meaning.  Some, finally, invite us to imagine ourselves in mysterious otherworlds, such as Mandeville's Travels and Sir Orfeo, both of which focus on travel and self knowledge.  These exciting and challenging works continue to speak to us about the quest to pursue ideals and to change the world and ourselves.\n",

Concurrently with our study of these earlier works, you’ll be reading Paradise Lost, which you should complete by the end of the spring break. At that point, you’ll be in a position to interpret Milton’s three Restoration masterpieces in the light of his grand—and rebellious—aim of reforming England’s civil and religious community, an aim Milton boldly reaffirms in 1660 in defiance of the Restoration of monarchy.",

This was a period of great stylistic innovation, as authors experimented with the use of symbolism and the adaptation of classical mythology and explored medieval/gothic images and themes.

From steampunk to political rhetoric, from movies to sex, writers and artists look back to the Victorian era for inspiration and challenge.  One reason might be that Britain was the first country to experience the full effects of industrialized capitalism, with the opportunities and misery that it created.  It also developed one of the largest empires in history, an empire whose legacy continues to shape global politics in good and bad ways.  For all these reasons, understanding the Victorians is key to understanding ourselves.",

Class likewise remains inescapable in Victorian fiction with its sharp sense of a world divided into haves and have nots; depictions of the catastrophic effects of the factory system on the urban poor pervade Victorian literature and challenge readers to ponder how, and if, reading might lead to political action.  Race has increasingly reshaped understandings of the literature of the period; although Britain abolished slavery in 1833-34, the period saw both a heightening of racist rhetoric and representation and the growth of a market for works by writers of color from the colonies, including Mary Seacole, J. J. Thomas, and Toru Dutt.  ",

Afropessimism, on the other hand, emerges at the turn of the 21st century in an interview between Saidiya Hartman and Frank B. Wilderson III as a meta theory that evinces a skepticism about the utility of the term Human to understand the positionality of blackness in an antiblack world. Blackness, for Afropessemists, becomes a technology by which the Human constitutes its Humanity as difference. This body of work generally understands the end of antiblackness as only possible with the destruction of “the world,” understood to be definitionally antiblack.",

Du Bois’s “The Comet,” this course traces the relationships between African American literature, politics and sociality through the representation of blackness in relationship to technology.

Put another way, this class is attentive to the way that the future is signified in the contemporary world as well as the fact that, following Afropessimism’s analysis, that world, and thus this mode of signifying blackness, may itself be antiblack. As a result, this course juxtaposes traditionally, technologically, Afrofuturist works, with those such as Parable of the Sower, The Broken Earth Trilogy, and An Unkindness of Ghosts that depict Black futures at or after the apocalypse.",

In this discussion-based course, which fulfills the Literature Core LE, we will closely examine five of Austen’s major novels alongside the far more\nvoluminous body of scholarship, sequels, screen adaptations, and fan responses that these works have inspired. Besides considering Austen's distinctive style, her contribution to the development of the novel form, and the cultural and historical context in which she wrote, we will explore a\nvariety of ways in which the author and her work have been represented and reimagined across the globe. By focusing on a single author in depth, members of this course will not only investigate the array of cultural functions that “Jane Austen” has come to serve, but also hone their ability to analyze fundamental aspects of literary technique.",

The course will focus on understanding the relationships between literature, art, politics, and memory, and it will foster learning by doing as well as community outreach and relationship with local Indigenous communities.\nStudents will visit local art galleries and other locales, create and maintain a class blog to be featured on the course website, and engage in their own creative forms of decolonial critique through weekly blog posts. Students' final projects will also explore decolonial perspectives and activism that specifically involves local practices of water activism and re-linking to Indigenous ways of knowing.

Then we'll take a look at two social movements that, while by no means underground, tend to fly below the radar: the prison abolition movement and the fight for public schools. While all of these social movements have different emphases, they also overlap quite a bit in their systemic analysis of society and their strategies for action. As activist, organizer, and trainer Rinku Sen observes, \\\"the history of community organizing and social movements is replete with tactics learned in one movement being applied to another.\\\"",

How do the groups, collectives, nonprofits, and communities propelling these different social movements organize themselves, their leadership, their strategies, and their activities? How do they make decisions? What do meetings and planning processes look like? What do they do when they disagree? How do they recruit and mobilize? How do they communicate with and confront the general public, elected officials, and the more powerful elements of the ruling class? How do they talk about the work they're doing?  How do they develop a vision of the world they'd like to live in while still inhabiting the present one, with all its flaws and injustices? We'll also examine the role of education in organizations working for social change. Whether through trainings, \\\"political education,\\\" reading groups, or small group activities associated with popular education, many of the social-movement groups we'll study have developed educational strategies and curricula.

We will ground our inquiry in government studies, as well as sociological, historical, and educational writings. Standard literature, such as a memoir, a selection of poems, some short fiction, and a novel will further open up our twin themes of literacy and multiculturalism – as will less “official” literature, such as manifestos and the transcribed stories of immigrants, refugees, and other marginalized communities.",
    "prereqInfo": "We begin with the basic understanding of literacy as reading and writing, noting that, according to the National Survey of Adult Literacy, 46% of Americans scored in the lowest two levels of a five-tiered literacy test. What does this mean? Are such tests accurate or otherwise helpful?   What about your basic literacy? As you read this syllabus, you’re making use of basic abilities that you’ve likely been practicing most of your life through formal schooling, daily routines, recreational pursuits, and work-related duties. But there’s more. On another level, you bring knowledge to your reading (some conscious, some unconscious), and the ideological field supplies you with assumptions about the role of literacy in your development, the role of a university course in your plans for your personal and professional life, and your position in a society that constantly raises the standards of literacy, basing success on your ability to keep up. Thus the very word “literacy” calls into play many beliefs we have about our class system, our cultural life, economic and political structures, and educational institutions. Accordingly, our analysis will move beyond basic “reading and writing” to wider concepts of literacy in our society, investigating issues that have much to do with our role as public citizens involved in shaping our individual and collective future.  In tandem with our “classroom” work, our service-learning work in the community (see Your Practicum as Literacy Workers, below) will enable us to develop more “tangible” understandings of the ways that literacy, educational theories, practices, and the construction of knowledge and skills through educational policies provide a “map” of the shifting socioeconomic, cultural, and political terrains of the U.S., the institutional inequities that result from these arrangements, as well as the justice work needed to transform those inequities.",

Putting English skills to work in your internship tasks will allow you to see how communication changes with contexts and audiences. You will be able to practice new voices and styles. Depending on the internship activities, you may practice communication germane to marketing, development, editing, social media, and the professional office. You will receive feedback from your site supervisors and instructors as to your understanding of these new ways of communicating. In this course, you will keep a weekly journal detailing the work you do in the internship; analyzing the significance of the work within the greater activity of the internship site; and making connections between the work and the academic learning you have done in English. You will also write a final paper on a topic agreed upon with the instructor, which should build upon the writing you've done in the journals.",

To graduate with a BA in English, students must write a 13-17 page (4,000-5,500 word) senior paper that contains substantive and original analytical insights. In this rigorous and intensive seminar, students receive instruction on writing this paper from tenured and tenure-track faculty in English. Students learn how to choose a topic and formulate a research question, conduct primary and secondary research, and produce a written document that incorporates research and analysis. Faculty teach students to produce an extended, scholarly essay though discussions of method, research, and development; instruction in specific writing techniques; workshopping and revising drafts; solving problems; and creating a coherent and elegant final product. While the subjects about which students write vary depending on student interest and faculty expertise, at least 50% of the course grade is determined by students writing performance. Most students fulfill the senior paper requirement with a traditional seminar paper, but students sometimes complete alternative projects, such as blogs, analytic projects that incorporate creative or personal elements, collaborative projects, or projects that involve the creation of a podcast, video, web site, or some other means of documenting student learning and writing skills. The senior seminar also functions as a capstone experience that fulfills many of the Student Learning Outcomes for the English major. ",

This course focuses on the close analysis and interpretation of plays written by dramatists from around the world from the late-nineteenth to the twenty-first century. The plays we will study are set in Europe, Great Britain, North America, Africa, and Asia, and we will examine each carefully in light of the unique historical and social contexts in which they were produced, their creation and uses of aesthetic form, and their impact on individuals and communities.",

Theatrical works illustrate how the meanings ascribed to physical bodies are at the heart of social differences such as gender, sexuality, class, race, disability, and national identity. We will look at each play in its original cultural context as well as through the creative lens of more recent productions and assess how both historical and more recent reimagining changes the meaning of the work. We will also make use of the rich theatrical resources and cultural organizations available in communities such as the Twin Cities.\n",

No previous experience with Old English or any other language is necessary or expected; undergraduates and graduate students from all departments are welcome.  For graduate students in English, Old English I may count for the rhetoric/language/literacy distribution area. This course also fulfills the literary theory/linguistic requirement for the undergraduate English major. A knowledge of Old English will allow you to touch the most ancient literary sensibilities in the English tradition; these sensibilities are familiar and strange at the same time, as we sense our deep cultural connection to these texts across the centuries, yet also find that the past is a strange place indeed.  The power of Old English literature has profoundly influenced authors such as Tennyson, Pound, Graves, Wilbur, Hopkins, Gunn, Auden, Seamus Heaney, C.S. Lewis, and of course, J.R.R. Tolkien.",

We will read and translate the poem in the original Old English; thus ENGL 4612 (or a similar course resulting in a basic reading knowledge of Old English) is a prerequisite. \\\"Beowulf\\\" has been the object of intensive scholarly study; we will delve into the debates over the poem's date, genesis, manuscript and historical context and critical interpretation.
