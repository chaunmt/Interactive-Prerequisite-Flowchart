    "info": "alternate histories have long been a popular subgenre of science fiction. alternate historical novels are set in the \\\"real\\\" world, but imagine the real world to be shaped by different historical outcomes and events. typically, they are set in a fictional historical timeline prompted by \\\"what if\\\" questions: what if nazi germany and japan had won world war ii? what if john brown's raid at harper's ferry had succeeded? authors use alternate historical settings to cast new perspectives on factual history, as well as to make claims about the nature of history, historical memory, historical records, and historical consciousness themselves. while such works tend to be seen as genre fiction, major literary writers like philip roth and michael chabon have also penned their own alternate histories. in addition, political figures as diverse as winston chamberlain and newt gingrich have speculated about alternate historical timelines. not surprisingly, alternate histories tend to bring up questions about historical knowledge itself. thinkers have long debated this subject, asking questions like: how do we know what we \\\"know\\\" about the past? how does the act of constructing non-fictional narratives of the past shape or influence our perception of past events? and what or who makes historical change happen; great individuals? ideological conflicts and influential ideas? economic changes? in this course, we'll read a selection of alternate historical fiction, as well as examine some influential theories of history as an object of study and analysis. we'll ask what kinds of cultural, social, and political values motivate writers to construct hypothetical historical realities. finally, you will experiment with writing your own alternate historical short fiction or essay, crafting a fictional or non-fictional narrative set in/about an alternate historical timeline, and justifying your own decisions in reimagining the past.",

    "info": "america's relationship with food and eating has changed profoundly over the last fifty years. at the heart of this revolution was a group of charismatic personalities who through writing and television brought first european and then global sensibilities to the american table. they persuaded americans that food and cooking were not just about nutrition but also forms of pleasure, entertainment, and art; ways of exploring other cultures; and means of declaring, discovering, or creating identity. their work would eventually transform the american landscape, helping give rise to the organic movement, farmers markets, locavorism, and american cuisine, as well as celebrity chefs, the food network, and restaurant reality television. in the meantime, the environmental movement was sending its own shockwaves through american consciousness of food production and consumption. the joining together of these movements--culinary and environmental--has brought a new ethical dimension to the subject that is now at the forefront of current concerns about american food. insofar as we eat, we necessarily make choices that have profound implications for our health, our communities, the environment, and those who work in the food industry, broadly defined. this class will trace the american food revolution with the intent of understanding how our current system came to be and thinking through the ethical implications of our daily actions. we will read classic literature from the rise of the movement, in varying degrees instructional, personal and documentary, while viewing some seminal television moments for the food culture we now know. we will give particular attention to recent work that focuses on the personal and environmental ethics of food.",

    "title": "Afrofuturism/Afropessimism",
    "info": "in 1993, mark dery coined the term afrofuturism to describe “[s]peculative fiction that treats african-american themes and addresses african-american concerns in the context of twentieth- century technoculture — and, more generally, african-american signification that appropriates images of technology and a prosthetically enhanced future.\\\" at the same time, dery places this fictional treatment of black futures in the context of a history systematically denied. afropessimism, on the other hand, emerges at the turn of the 21st century in an interview between saidiya hartman and frank b. wilderson iii as a meta theory that evinces a skepticism about the utility of the term human to understand the positionality of blackness in an antiblack world. blackness, for afropessemists, becomes a technology by which the human constitutes its humanity as difference. this body of work generally understands the end of antiblackness as only possible with the destruction of “the world,” understood to be definitionally antiblack.\n\nstarting with w.e.b. du bois’s “the comet,” this course traces the relationships between african american literature, politics and sociality through the representation of blackness in relationship to technology. this course interrogates dery’s description of afro futurism as both descriptive and ideological. put another way, this class is attentive to the way that the future is signified in the contemporary world as well as the fact that, following afropessimism’s analysis, that world, and thus this mode of signifying blackness, may itself be antiblack. as a result, this course juxtaposes traditionally, technologically, afrofuturist works, with those such as parable of the sower, the broken earth trilogy, and an unkindness of ghosts that depict black futures at or after the apocalypse.\n\nstudents should expect to think and rethink the relationship between technology as a signifier of the future and those structures that continue antiblackness and colonialism. additionally, students should also expect to gain a broad conceptualization of african american speculative fiction. finally, students can expect to read texts of black fiction that imagine futures in ways beyond the disasters of not only antiblackness, but of misogyny, heterosexism, ableism, and transphobia.",
