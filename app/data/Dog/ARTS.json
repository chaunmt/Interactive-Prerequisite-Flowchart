allow artists to imagine otherwise, conjure different futures, and connect to ancestral pasts that co-mingle with present lived experiences? course readings center bipoc voices and focus on issues of representation, cultural appropriation, and decolonization. we look at the emergence of ‘fine art,’ a cultural category steeped in race, power, and the politics of exclusion; the history of the black art movement and its commitment to political purpose in art; the challenges that arise from the insistence that the political align with the aesthetic. the course explores indigenous organizing and resurgence as well as the politics of opacity and refusal. we will study socially engaged art forms, afro- and indigenous futurisms, creative practices that explode distinctions between “traditional” and “modern,” art and craft, and engage with art as a field of cultural expression deeply involved in imagining and demanding social justice.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{},{"code":"ARTS

complex and varied artist-centered approaches to the social, ethical, political, and environmental challenges of our times. as an emerging form of art, contemporary socially engaged art is not a monolithic practice and goals amongst practitioners exhibit a wide range of approaches. artists may work towards changing dominant systems in order to foster more positive outcomes; other artists strive to acknowledge and call out complexity and contradictions of those same systems. while artists working in this field, commonly called social practice work, investigate a broad set of topics and media approaches, with varying motivations and intentions, what they share is a foregrounding of the subject and content that informs the work.  \n\nthis course examines the way engaged social art practice can lead to sustained connections and shared visions within communities and institutions; can create a more just and equitable culture; and can address many pressing environmental and social issues of our day. the class investigates the role of the art as a catalyst for social change. we will approach this through questions and dialogue, acknowledging that many of the tensions and contradictions cannot be resolved but are still worth the effort to recognize and address. \n \nthis course combines a research-based learning environment with a strong studio- based component. through readings, presentations, field trips, experiential and sensory opportunities, case studies, video presentations, and class project initiatives, we will explore the spectrum of contemporary strategies to a socially engaged approach to art.  students will create hands-on and a culminating collaborative creative project and will learn to identify themes, develop ideas individually, and collectively and execute these ideas through multiple ways of knowing and making of art projects. through a variety of media, students will be encouraged to explore issues and address themes that they
