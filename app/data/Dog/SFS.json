Conservation is a complex undertaking and partly entails involving humans. It has therefore increasingly become important to address or relate human dimensions to conservation and management of natural resources. This course will examine the relationship between people, the environment and associated natural resources. In the process, it will explore how people’s behavior, values and knowledge, influence and are affected by decisions on management of natural resources and conservation of wildlife. It will use social science knowledge and tools to effectively incorporate societal values into conservation planning and decision-making, and to build stronger and more diverse partnerships. Students will also learn human dimensions concepts, the tools and methods that can be used in conservation outreach and communication.\nThis course will focus on the human dimensions on conservation in the Amboseli Ecosystem in the South-eastern rangelands of Kenya. Students and Faculty will examine the cultural, economic, political and social context of the Maasai people and other ethnic groups in relationship to wildlife and natural resources utilization and conservation. To understand the current and future management and conservation of wildlife and other natural resources in the region, students will also examine the influence of traditional beliefs and attitudes in natural resource use and conservation practices. The influence of modern lifestyle, conservation and management practices, national policies and laws as well as land uses and socio-political and economic changes among the Maasai people will be evaluated. Specifically, human dimensions of conservation issues will focus on the Maasai Group Ranches, national parks, wildlife sanctuaries or conservancies especially those in the former Kimana Group Ranch, and the expansive private land parcels along the Kenya-Tanzania border. At the end of the semester, students will use and apply the human dimensions aspects learned in their directed research work which will be guided the Faculty in-charge of the course. The findings will be presented to diverse stakeholders comprising of community members, local leaders, national and Kajiado County government officials.",

SFS center for wildlife management studies in Tanzania is an ideal location to explore the ecological and human aspects of large carnivore conservation. The center is located between the Ngorongoro-Serengeti (NSE) and Tarangire-Manyara (TME) ecosystems in northern Tanzania. Both ecosystems have largely intact carnivore guilds that occur within and outside the protected areas. The large carnivores are one of the main attractions to a vibrant photographic tourism industry. In addition, large carnivores attract high premiums among the trophy hunters in the area. Despite the high economic values, carnivores in northern Tanzania are under immense threats from human-related effects such as habitat loss, and conflicts with pastoralists. In order to address these challenges, large carnivores have attracted high interest among conservationists and scientists in Northern Tanzania. African wild dogs, African lions, spotted hyenas, cheetahs and leopards have received high attention due to their charismatic appeal and the manifold threats facing them. Among those species, lions and leopards are among the big five and are highly sought after by tourists. In order to address the conservation threats and better understand the ecology of these large carnivore species in Northern Tanzania, several conservation and research projects have been initiated. These include: The Tarangire Lion Research Project in Tarangire/Manyara National Parks and the surrounding areas, Kope Lion project in Ngorongoro Conservation Area, and species-specific projects in Serengeti National park focusing on lion, cheetah, spotted hyena and African wild dog.",

Until recently, the island’s economy centered around small-scale local fisheries, but a growing tourism industry and recent devastation from Hurricanes Irma and Maria have meant major changes to the community and marine ecosystem. As climate events continue to perturb the marine environment and the economy and the population grow and diversify, so too do the demands on the marine environment. Marine megafauna play important roles in the TCI, both ecologically and economically, making this the perfect place to take a deep dive into their characteristics, threats, and conservation.",

These include some of the world’s most endangered and rare species such as the Tana River red colobus, Tana River mangabey, Percival’s black and white colobus, and de Brazza’s monkeys. Globally and across the continent, most primate populations are declining due to habitat loss, and poaching for bush meat and other products. In most regions of Kenya, habitat loss, habitat fragmentation and human primate conflicts are the major challenge to primate conservation. These effects have been amplified by a continuously increasing human population particularly in the rural areas where there most natural areas for wildlife occur. The increased human population is associated with activities such as agriculture, charcoal burning and conversion of land for human settlement which have led to loss and degradation of primate habitats. The loss of habitat has resulted to fragmentation and reduced populations of primates as critical habitats becoming scarce. Today the scenario is that of isolated populations of primates, with more habitat specific species getting confined mostly to within protected areas. However due to their broad habitat and long ranging movement of a number of primates, areas outside protected areas are still very critical to primate conservation.",

GNH and a leadership committed to conservation has led to Bhutan having more than 70% forest cover and about 50% of its land area under formal protection. Bhutan’s forests which fall within the eastern Himalayan region is characterized by extensive and numerous mountains and valleys, hosting some of the world’s highest peaks and a diversity of vegetation and wildlife. Bhutan’s natural landscapes host an estimated 770 species of birds and other diverse fauna, including the takin, snow leopard, golden langur,\nblue sheep, and tiger. Ecosystems range from subtropical broadleaf forests in the south, to subalpine conifer forests, alpine shrub, and high-mountain meadows. The highest elevations comprise rock and ice.\nThese forests and natural landscapes are integral to Bhutan’s development, and key to ensuring food, water and energy security.\nOver four weeks, students will learn about the interplay between GNH, resource use and development.\nThrough travel to various parts of the country, students will be exposed to the culture and history, religious traditions, environmental issues, and conservation policies. Students will stay in Bhutanese villages and trek across Himalayan landscapes to experience and understand rural livelihoods and their connection to the natural environment. Academically, students will develop skills in assessing environmental problems, designing socio-economic surveys, conducting resource assessments, and communicating results.

The concept of environmental justice (EJ) combines  notions of environmental sustainability and everyday environments with demands for social  justice (Agyeman 2013, Walker G. 2012). EJ focuses on the unequitable distribution of  environmental risks and governmental protection among people of different economic and  ethnic backgrounds (Schlosberg 2009). This concept has a long history in conservation and  sustainable development. The modern view derived from the US civil rights movement and  advocates’ calls for racial equality with environmental action.

It’s one of the most charismatic and charming species but its conservation and  population status has continued to attract a lot of concern within and beyond Africa. A key worry  is that it’s conservation is increasingly becoming uncertain across the entire African continent as due illegal poaching, landscape fragmentation, and retaliatory attacks by local communities due  to prevalence of human-elephant conflicts. At the beginning of the 20th century, there were  several millions of elephants roaming across Africa (Douglas-Hamilton 1979), but today, they  have declined rapidly, and are estimated to be nearly 450,000 - 700,000 (Stephenson, 2007).  \nIllegal poaching has been and remains the biggest threat to the survival of elephants, and this  threat is rampant throughout the entire continent (Douglas-Hamilton et al. 1992). Habitat loss,  associated with anthropogenic effects is the second biggest threat to the future conservation of  the species, and in the last century, large swathes of elephant natural habitats have been  converted into human dominated landscapes (Esikuri 1998). This not only leads to loss, reduction, and degradation of elephant prime habitats, but curtails their free movement, reduces their  home range, blocks their movement corridors and routes but increases conflicts with humans  (Spinage 1990). Collectively, this matrix creates a very inhabitable and hostile environment for elephant survival and conservation programs in all its range in Africa. \n",

You will be introduced to the current and past distributions of tropical rainforests, their biodiversity, and their relationships with the abiotic  environment, human use, present threats, and restoration practices. This course aims to bring  together an understanding of the underlying ecological processes that affect rainforests (and other  tropical vegetation) with the role of human society in shaping the present and future rainforests of  the Wet Tropics. The course will take the Australian Wet Tropics as a case study to investigate this  field, yet many of the skills you learn here can be transferred to other systems. Topics covered will  include: biophysical determinants of which vegetation type occurs where; past, present, and future  threats to Wet Tropics rainforests; and the theory and practice of rainforest restoration. \nThe course also has a practical component. You will be taught field techniques for carrying out field  research, data analysis, and communication of results.  \nThe course is a mixture of class lectures, field lectures, field laboratory courses, workshops, field  trips, and readings to complement the material presented in the lectures. A major emphasis is on  field skills, the collection, management and analyses of data, and skills of writing a scientific paper. A  wide range of material will be provided and should be used to study the class topics and to acquire  the desired skills. Be aware that all material covered in class, lectures, field lectures, and field trips will be required.\n",

    "info": "Demand for agricultural products is expected to increase by an estimated 1.1% per year until 2050 due to drivers such as population growth, increases in per capita consumption, and diet changes. While the widespread use of monocropping systems in industrialized agriculture has managed to sustain food production, trends in global climate change are leading to increasing unpredictable local climates and posing a challenge to farmers worldwide. Moreover, large scale monocropping systems exert a heavy toll on the environment and on local biodiversity.",

    "info": "This course will focus on the evolution, biogeography, ecology, behaviour, and conservation  of marsupials of Australia. \nAustralia is one of the most ancient continents on our planet with geological features dating back to  more than 1.7 billon years. Its history was influenced by long periods of isolation from other land  masses while uplifts and erosion of mountains, forming, and disappearance of inland seas and cycles  of fires, drought, cyclones, and flooding shaped this land. This long history resulted in a unique  diversity of plants and animals. Ancient forms of mammals, such as egg-laying monotremes and  some small marsupials lived amongst Australia’s dinosaurs about 110 million years ago and formed  part of the ancient Gondwana fauna. After the extinction of the dinosaurs and when Australia finally  broke away from Gondwana it took with it its unique array of mammals into isolation. Freed from  the past dominating dinosaurs and finding themselves on a vast continent with no competing intruders, Australia’s ancient marsupials could thrive and diversify. Marsupial ‘hippos’, ‘rhinos,’ and  ‘tapirs’ occupied the land while killer-kangaroos targeted the weakest of these herds of grazing marsupials.\n",

This course will examine the different ways that winter affects human and non-human systems. This course brings you to the world-famous Torres del Paine National Park in the stillness of winter, to observe the camelid  guanacos and flightless ñandús as they get ready for the approaching winter. The shortening days drive  changes in the ranching practices in the estancias in the area as they move their livestock to winter  pastures. The approaching Winter Solstice also connects indigenous communities as they make ready  for the coming New Year. Finally, the winter brings the season when glaciers would normally be  recovering their mass. However, climate change is creating changes in all of these interactions. ",
    "prereqInfo": "High-latitude regions, such as Patagonia, are often more prone to the effects of climate change, making changes more apparent and significant. Indeed, climate change in Patagonia is quite clear, and one of  the seasons that have seen the most marked change is the winter. There has been less precipitation, and higher temperatures, meaning that there is less overall precipitation, and that which falls tends  more to be rain. This is leading to changes in ecological and social contexts of the Patagonian winter that  we will explore in this course. ",

We will look at these aspects in general and then demonstrate them in case studies of species in the Wet Tropics. To formulate a background understanding of habitats of the Wet Tropic’s wildlife, we will explore the origin of the main landscape formations of this part of Australia by looking at geological and biogeographical factors that shaped the landscape and its biota. You will be introduced to Australia’s flora and fauna and the unique species that inhabit the diverse habitats of the Wet Tropics. We then will deal with some basic ecological concepts of biodiversity and why so many species can co-exist in one place. This will also involve learning skills to obtain data on various parameters of wildlife populations to assess the impact of habitat loss, fragmentation, introduced species and climate change on them. Field trips and field work in various parts of the Atherton Tablelands will help you in learning these skills.\nUsing the obtained data on wildlife populations we will explore various conservation techniques in order to mitigate these threats to the flora and fauna of the Wet Tropics, how to identify partners and resources for conservation work, how to triage conservation needs, and how to best advocate conservation. We will consider the role of corridors or landscape linkages, particularly along riparian areas, and ways in which restoration and landscape rehabilitation can overcome negative effects of human driven landscape modification and climate change on these ecosystems. We will consider options on how to efficiently control pest animals and their impacts on native flora and fauna.",

    "info": "Globally, most natural resources face enormous pressure from multiple direct and indirect  human activities, with delirious consequences for humans and natural life. Further, most of the  resources are limited, and thus easily prone to any disturbance by humans. In this regard, a lot  of effort has gone to promote sustainable utilization of natural resources with emphasis on  minimizing damaging human activities and overexploitation. Most parts of East Africa, Kenya  included are dominated by Savanna or rangeland environments which are naturally dry for most  of the year due to scanty annual rainfall. However, these are the same landscapes where diverse biota endowments are found but which are currently under siege and near extermination by  rapid human population growth and unregulated land-use changes.  \nThe Amboseli Ecosystem is characterized by a semi-arid environment, and rainfall is received  twice a year but it’s scarce, unpredictable and low (300-800mm per year). This creates a water  deficient landscape, and most of the water is found in scattered rivers, streams, springs, and  wetlands like swamps, all linked to the hydrology of the neighboring Mt. Kilimanjaro. These  conditions tend to favour wildlife conservation and pastoralism, the latter being the historical key land use by the local pastoral Maasai people. However, immigration into the region by  agricultural communities starting in the 1960 through the 1980s saw introduction of farming as  a new land use along the wet and arable slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro along the Kenya-Tanzania border. Thereafter, irrigated agriculture mostly for commercial purposes was introduced in the  water systems of the Maasai Group Ranches where rain-fed farming is not possible. This lifestyle  shift has seen pastoralism nearly replaced and dominated by agro-pastoralism among the  Maasai.  \nToday, the dominant human activities, mostly irrigated farming and livestock in the Maasai group  ranches and the former Kimana Group Ranch keeping rely on the springs and rivers emanating  from Mt. Kilimanjaro. The wildlife ecological dynamics in the ecosystem is also entirely  dependent on these wetlands, which are the predominant dry season concentration areas as  water and forage resources elsewhere diminish. Consequently, management of water resources  is a major conservation and livelihood issue. Often there are conflicts associated with water use  among humans and between humans and wildlife, which is attributed to diminished availability  of this vital resource. Resolving these conflicts and promoting wise use of available water  resources is a major preoccupation of wildlife and natural resources managers in the area, Water  Resource Users Associations (WRUAs) and the Water Resources Authority (WRA), the lead Kenya Government agency on water management.  \nThe Amboseli Ecosystem lies contiguous to the Tsavo West and Chyulu Hills National Parks which are part of the Tsavo Conservation Area, the largest wildlife conservation landscape in Kenya. Chyulu Hills was gazetted as a protected area in 1983 to enhance protection of its wildlife  resources and watershed services. It’s recognized as one of the important water catchment areas  situated in the dry lands of the country and provides water to a vast landscape and diverse  beneficiaries including Mombasa County. However, this service is threatened by destruction and \ngeneral environmental degradation of the hills by livestock grazing, charcoal burning, and accidental fires. Neighboring the Chyulu Hills N. Park is the expansive Tsavo West N. Park, which  covers more than 9,000Km, and it’s one of the important wildlife conservation areas in the  country. Prior to its gazettement as a protected area in 1948, the area was used by pastoral  communities like the Maasai. Over the years, human population and land use changes especially farming, adjust the park boundaries have increased significantly. This has led to escalation of human-wildlife..",

Though the SFS model emphasizes field-based methodologies, there is much to be learned in those aspects of research that lie beyond the fieldwork: building a robust question, vetting sources of information to produce a high-quality literature review, placing novel inquiry within a theoretical and empirical context and analyzing existing data to create a strong discussion of the research question. \nThe aim of this course is to provide students the opportunity to explore existing Center resources and develop methods of inquiry to analyze environmental issues relevant to the communities in which we operate. We will investigate the ways that various methods and theories distinguish (or not) fact from interpretation, cause from correlation, and advocacy from objectivity. Through their research projects, students will contribute to a growing body of scientific research that informs local conservation and resource management decisions near SFS Centers around the world.\nEach student will be led by a faculty advisor that will produce research questions and methods, analyze data, and communicate results in one or across several of the following disciplines: ecology, conservation, earth sciences, natural resource management, anthropology, human geography, and environmental policy. All FEI projects are collaborative in process, but individual in outputs. Depending on the project, students may work together on the development and analysis of questions, but individual students must submit final assignments independently. The course is designed to build on the information students have learned in their disciplinary courses at each Center.  In addition, faculty will provide lectures and workshops specifically designed to assist students in understanding the scientific process and presenting results in both written, spoken, and visual formats.
