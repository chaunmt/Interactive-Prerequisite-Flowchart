Conservation is a complex undertaking and partly entails involving humans. It has therefore increasingly become important to address or relate human dimensions to conservation and management of natural resources. This course will examine the relationship between people, the environment and associated natural resources. In the process, it will explore how people’s behavior, values and knowledge, influence and are affected by decisions on management of natural resources and conservation of wildlife. It will use social science knowledge and tools to effectively incorporate societal values into conservation planning and decision-making, and to build stronger and more diverse partnerships. Students will also learn human dimensions concepts, the tools and methods that can be used in conservation outreach and communication.\nThis course will focus on the human dimensions on conservation in the Amboseli Ecosystem in the South-eastern rangelands of Kenya. Students and Faculty will examine the cultural, economic, political and social context of the Maasai people and other ethnic groups in relationship to wildlife and natural resources utilization and conservation. To understand the current and future management and conservation of wildlife and other natural resources in the region, students will also examine the influence of traditional beliefs and attitudes in natural resource use and conservation practices. The influence of modern lifestyle, conservation and management practices, national policies and laws as well as land uses and socio-political and economic changes among the Maasai people will be evaluated. Specifically, human dimensions of conservation issues will focus on the Maasai Group Ranches, national parks, wildlife sanctuaries or conservancies especially those in the former Kimana Group Ranch, and the expansive private land parcels along the Kenya-Tanzania border. At the end of the semester, students will use and apply the human dimensions aspects learned in their directed research work which will be guided the Faculty in-charge of the course. The findings will be presented to diverse stakeholders comprising of community members, local leaders, national and Kajiado County government officials.",

Conservation cannot, therefore, be fully understood and practiced from a pure natural science perspective. Exploring human dimensions of conservation, using heuristic tools and concepts from\nsocial sciences, is indeed essential in realizing the desired holistic approach needed to restore biodiversity to pre-1970s levels. This course will focus on the human dimensions of conservation of endangered species in Kenya. The course will examine and expand the students? understanding of the multiplex relationships between people, the endangered species, and their environment, including associated natural resources. In the process, it will explore how people?s behavior, values, and knowledge influence and are affected by decisions on management of endangered species. The overarching question to be addressed is how to achieve a healthy interaction between politics, economics, cultures, and technology so that populations of endangered species are conserved and\nrestored in a manner that values humans wellbeing as well. The course will use a wide range of social sciences knowledge and tools, but mostly Anthropology and Political Ecology, to effectively incorporate societal values into conservation planning, technology, and decision-making around selected endangered species in Kenya, and to build stronger and more diverse partnerships. Students will also learn human dimensions concepts, the tools and methods that can be used in conservation research, outreach, and communication.\n\nSee \\\"Course Overview\\\" on syllabus for full description.",

And by extension, how do the Chilean conservation management objectives and operations map onto the broader world stage. \n\nThis is a very transformative time in Chilean conservation management. The ministries are under re-organization; those that hold political influence now may not be the ones in office next year. Many media outlets such as CNN, the New York Times, and The Economist have had recent profiles on the influence of foreign private entities largely shaping the conservation scene in Chile. This course will allow stimulating debate and exploration and send students home with unprecedented insight.\n\nWhile the course will expose students to broad conservation issues that face the entire planet, we will ground these topics in case studies from the diverse locations we visit. Students will learn concepts in conservation both theoretical and practical from lectures and field trips. Throughout the semester, students will be exposed to a wide range of conservation practices, policies and critiques through discussions, direct observations, and assessments of various conservation initiatives that are being implemented and co-managed by diverse stakeholders including: local government agencies, international governments and investors, private companies, local and international organizations, and researchers. The course will provide students with a background to engage in a nuanced discussion of conservation at multiple scales.

SFS center for wildlife management studies in Tanzania is an ideal location to explore the ecological and human aspects of large carnivore conservation. The center is located between the Ngorongoro-Serengeti (NSE) and Tarangire-Manyara (TME) ecosystems in northern Tanzania. Both ecosystems have largely intact carnivore guilds that occur within and outside the protected areas. The large carnivores are one of the main attractions to a vibrant photographic tourism industry. In addition, large carnivores attract high premiums among the trophy hunters in the area. Despite the high economic values, carnivores in northern Tanzania are under immense threats from human-related effects such as habitat loss, and conflicts with pastoralists. In order to address these challenges, large carnivores have attracted high interest among conservationists and scientists in Northern Tanzania. African wild dogs, African lions, spotted hyenas, cheetahs and leopards have received high attention due to their charismatic appeal and the manifold threats facing them. Among those species, lions and leopards are among the big five and are highly sought after by tourists. In order to address the conservation threats and better understand the ecology of these large carnivore species in Northern Tanzania, several conservation and research projects have been initiated. These include: The Tarangire Lion Research Project in Tarangire/Manyara National Parks and the surrounding areas, Kope Lion project in Ngorongoro Conservation Area, and species-specific projects in Serengeti National park focusing on lion, cheetah, spotted hyena and African wild dog.",

These include some of the world’s most endangered and rare species such as the Tana River red colobus, Tana River mangabey, Percival’s black and white colobus, and de Brazza’s monkeys. Globally and across the continent, most primate populations are declining due to habitat loss, and poaching for bush meat and other products. In most regions of Kenya, habitat loss, habitat fragmentation and human primate conflicts are the major challenge to primate conservation. These effects have been amplified by a continuously increasing human population particularly in the rural areas where there most natural areas for wildlife occur. The increased human population is associated with activities such as agriculture, charcoal burning and conversion of land for human settlement which have led to loss and degradation of primate habitats. The loss of habitat has resulted to fragmentation and reduced populations of primates as critical habitats becoming scarce. Today the scenario is that of isolated populations of primates, with more habitat specific species getting confined mostly to within protected areas. However due to their broad habitat and long ranging movement of a number of primates, areas outside protected areas are still very critical to primate conservation.",

    "info": "The concept of environmental justice (EJ) refers to equal sustainable access to natural resources that are vital for human groups to achieve a meaningful, fulfilling, and happy life,  such as access to clean water, to nutritious and pesticide-free food, clean air, and to the  benefits of sustainable use of biodiversity. The concept of environmental justice (EJ) combines  notions of environmental sustainability and everyday environments with demands for social  justice (Agyeman 2013, Walker G. 2012). EJ focuses on the unequitable distribution of  environmental risks and governmental protection among people of different economic and  ethnic backgrounds (Schlosberg 2009). This concept has a long history in conservation and  sustainable development. The modern view derived from the US civil rights movement and  advocates’ calls for racial equality with environmental action. Socioeconomically disadvantaged  groups across the world have harnessed social justice action to fight against unequitable  environmental outcomes, although its origin is much older and can be traced back to historical  conflicts for limited natural resources.

    "info": "The African elephant (Loxodonta africana) is an important keystone species in Africa and has  profound influence on the structure and dynamics of landscapes where it co-exists with other  species. It’s one of the most charismatic and charming species but its conservation and  population status has continued to attract a lot of concern within and beyond Africa. A key worry  is that it’s conservation is increasingly becoming uncertain across the entire African continent as due illegal poaching, landscape fragmentation, and retaliatory attacks by local communities due  to prevalence of human-elephant conflicts. At the beginning of the 20th century, there were  several millions of elephants roaming across Africa (Douglas-Hamilton 1979), but today, they  have declined rapidly, and are estimated to be nearly 450,000 - 700,000 (Stephenson, 2007).  \nIllegal poaching has been and remains the biggest threat to the survival of elephants, and this  threat is rampant throughout the entire continent (Douglas-Hamilton et al. 1992). Habitat loss,  associated with anthropogenic effects is the second biggest threat to the future conservation of  the species, and in the last century, large swathes of elephant natural habitats have been  converted into human dominated landscapes (Esikuri 1998). This not only leads to loss, reduction, and degradation of elephant prime habitats, but curtails their free movement, reduces their  home range, blocks their movement corridors and routes but increases conflicts with humans  (Spinage 1990). Collectively, this matrix creates a very inhabitable and hostile environment for elephant survival and conservation programs in all its range in Africa. \n",

While the widespread use of monocropping systems in industrialized agriculture has managed to sustain food production, trends in global climate change are leading to increasing unpredictable local climates and posing a challenge to farmers worldwide. Moreover, large scale monocropping systems exert a heavy toll on the environment and on local biodiversity.\n\nThe Sustainable Food Systems course examines food systems broadly and aims to provide students an experiential learning opportunity while we explore tropical natural, cultural, and agricultural landscapes. The course provides an overview of agroecology, economic botany, and associated cultural, environmental and sustainability issues, and touches broadly on the historical, socialcultural, economic and political factors that shape food systems.\n\nLectures and activities in this course are aimed at addressing the following questions:\na) How do agricultural practices differ between Australia and Indonesia?\nb) What are the current and emerging challenges facing agricultural production, and what are\nsome sustainable solutions?\n\nThroughout the course students will be introduced to and are expected to gain hands-on experience on economic botany and research techniques.

Its history was influenced by long periods of isolation from other land  masses while uplifts and erosion of mountains, forming, and disappearance of inland seas and cycles  of fires, drought, cyclones, and flooding shaped this land. This long history resulted in a unique  diversity of plants and animals. Ancient forms of mammals, such as egg-laying monotremes and  some small marsupials lived amongst Australia’s dinosaurs about 110 million years ago and formed  part of the ancient Gondwana fauna. After the extinction of the dinosaurs and when Australia finally  broke away from Gondwana it took with it its unique array of mammals into isolation. Freed from  the past dominating dinosaurs and finding themselves on a vast continent with no competing intruders, Australia’s ancient marsupials could thrive and diversify. Marsupial ‘hippos’, ‘rhinos,’ and  ‘tapirs’ occupied the land while killer-kangaroos targeted the weakest of these herds of grazing marsupials.\n",

This course brings you to the world-famous Torres del Paine National Park in the stillness of winter, to observe the camelid  guanacos and flightless ñandús as they get ready for the approaching winter. The shortening days drive  changes in the ranching practices in the estancias in the area as they move their livestock to winter  pastures. The approaching Winter Solstice also connects indigenous communities as they make ready  for the coming New Year. Finally, the winter brings the season when glaciers would normally be  recovering their mass. However, climate change is creating changes in all of these interactions. \n\nHigh-latitude regions, such as Patagonia, are often more prone to the effects of climate change, making changes more apparent and significant. Indeed, climate change in Patagonia is quite clear, and one of  the seasons that have seen the most marked change is the winter. There has been less precipitation, and higher temperatures, meaning that there is less overall precipitation, and that which falls tends  more to be rain. This is leading to changes in ecological and social contexts of the Patagonian winter that  we will explore in this course. \n\nThis course covers past adaptations to historic winter climates, from plant and animal community distributions and the human settlement patterns driven by climate conditions for the maintenance of communities. We examine how the Patagonian winter drives the ecology and social contexts of the  region. \n",

However, the health of these ecosystems, and therefore the “Beautiful by Nature” motto, is under threat. At the local level, unsustainable and damaging fishing practices, increased water- based recreational activities, and coastal development are potentially major sources of disturbance.\n\nFurthermore, the ocean impacts of global climate change will continue to negatively affect marine organisms and ecosystem processes, adding an additional layer of complexity to the problem. Foundations of Tropical Marine Ecosystems: Monitoring and Management is an interdisciplinary three-week winter term course that highlights the ecological characteristics and current threats to coastal ecosystems, in addition to exploring existing and potential environmental management\napproaches that would encourage the sustainable development of small island nations such as the TCI. Course participants will gain knowledge of tropical marine ecosystem function and connectivity and will be introduced to the most pressing threats at the intersection of marine conservation and economic development. \n\nThe course will take place on the island of South Caicos which is at a pivotal time in its\ndevelopment. Until recently, the island’s economy centered around small-scale local fisheries, but tourism is now a growing industry and South Caicos is experiencing major changes to its social and structural fabric. As the economy and the population grow and diversify, so too do the demands on the marine environment, making this the perfect location to study a small, tropical island in transition.",

    "info": "The eastern Himalayan region is characterized by extensive and numerous mountains and valleys, hosting the world?s highest peaks and a diversity of vegetation and wildlife. Identified as one of the world?s ten biodiversity hot spots, the Kingdom of Bhutan is home to an estimated 770 species of birds and other diverse fauna, including the takin, snow leopard, golden langur, blue sheep, and tiger. Varied ecosystems are also found in the country, ranging from subtropical broadleaf forests in the south, to subalpine conifer forests, alpine shrub, and high-mountain meadows. The highest elevations comprise rock and ice. While located in the subtropics latitude-wise, Bhutan?s high altitude and mountainous terrain mean that its climate is more influenced by altitude than by latitude. The climate is dominated by summer monsoons which bring the majority of precipitation for the year. The country also has more than 70% forest cover and about 50% of Bhutan is under formal conservation protection.\nBhutan is internationally famous for its development concept of Gross National Happiness (GNH). GNH is the guiding principle of development guides Bhutan through its four pillars: good governance, cultural protection and preservation, sustainable development, and environmental conservation. Across the country, people have developed and maintained rich cultural traditions and social and political institutions that reflect the Buddhist principle of ?The Middle Path?, integrating people and nature as well as traditional knowledge systems and modern science. Sustainable management of natural resources, including soil, water, biodiversity, and minerals, is critical for Bhutan, as these resources are fundamental to the national identity as well as to the economy.\nIn early 2008, Bhutan?s government became a democratic constitutional monarchy, opening the door for devolution of authority to regional governments and communities. Since the majority of the population reside in rural areas, sustainable management of natural resources is critical for achieving the dual goals of poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation. Defining baselines for biodiversity and ecosystem function is critical and, coupled with training in field research methodologies and communication in science, scientists and environmental authorities are increasingly effective at achieving development and conservation goals.\nThe SFS-Bhutan program is a field-based course where students study a country and region characterized by dramatic mountain landscapes and rich flora and fauna. Traveling through Bhutan, our SFS group will learn about Bhutan?s forests and biodiversity. They will also be exposed to the role which culture and religion plays in forest and biodiversity conservation. Students will stay in Bhutanese villages and trek across Himalayan landscapes to experience and understand local environments and rural livelihoods. Academically, students will develop skills in assessing environmental problems, defining research questions, conducting field research, and communicating results. Students will learn camera trapping, forest measurement techniques, and landscape reading skills. Moreover, SFS students will come to appreciate the complexity of identifying and addressing conservation and development issues in a rapidly changing region.\nSFS partners with the Royal University of Bhutan (RUB), College of Natural Resources (CNR), and the Bhutan Ecological Society (BES), a Civil Society Organization promoting environmental sustainability in Bhutan. SFS students and faculty will collaborate with RUB, CNR and BES to advance their research agenda in several priority areas, including forest management, biodiversity conservation, community resource assessment, climate change, and development policy.",

On a planet whose surface is more than 70% ocean, we will also explore the important role of the oceans in the Earth Systems. We will study the science of climate past and current and the evidence for anthropogenic climate change.\n\nAs we build our understanding of how the globe functions, we will consistently ground our learning with our location in Patagonia. From the base of Puerto Natales, many national parks are only kilometers away. Glaciers that belong to the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, the world’s second largest contiguous ice field outside the polar regions, will be visited. Chile’s dynamic Andes range – which is still growing – and the active volcanoes of the lakes region of Chile are open to discovery. Fragile forests susceptible to wildfire will be examined.\n\nOne focus of this course will be the science of climate change, understanding the dynamics of the Quaternary Period (the time when periodic pulses of warm and cold influenced most earth systems; e.g., the ice ages) and the Anthropocene (the period where humans have begun to dominant earth systems). The Chilean Patagonia region, like other high-latitude regions, is hyper-susceptible to changes in climate, and the Southern Patagonian icefield is shown to be more vulnerable to climate change than other glaciers. Unpredictable rain- and snow-fall, glacial melt, temperature shifts, fires and droughts can wreak havoc on slow-growing plant ecosystems. Climatic shifts have effect on the trophic webs, freshwater catchments, and farming and ranching operations.\n\nUnderstanding the geosphere, biosphere, the cryosphere (the frozen environment) and their interactions, we will weave the study of human action and impact throughout Earth Systems: our food systems, energy systems, and the nexus of water/energy/agriculture and climate. Chile is where climate change can be observed and measured in palpable ways.",

Selected field exercises and field-based experiential hands-on learning sessions will be used to impart the expected learning and skills of the course. The course will be done in key wildlife and biodiversity conservation landscapes in Kenya, mainly:\n1. Amboseli region/ecosystem, situated in Southwest Kenya, along the Kenya-Tanzania borderland is a key African savannah elephant conservation landscape in the country. The population is one of the few elephant populations in the country that has fully recovered from the devastating\neffects of poaching in the 1970s and early 1980s. However, the landscape is rapidly getting transformed into a human-dominated environment posing a huge threat to conservation of wildlife including elephants, lions, cheetah etc. It's noteworthy that rampant poaching exterminated black rhinos in the Amboseli ecosystem, and to date this is still a big concern among conservationists.\n2. Maasai Mara ecosystem, which lies contiguous to the Serengeti N. Park in the Northern part of Tanzania, and it?s a key tourist destination in Kenya and East Africa. It?s home to endangered and iconic species including the African lion, elephant, cheetah, and black rhino, which frequently move between Maasai-Mara and Serengeti N Park. This presents an opportunity to examine cross-border collaboration and challenges in conservation of endangered species. Unethical tourism in Maasai Mara national reserve has direct ecological and demographic negative impacts on cheetah and lion conservation. However, the region has the best and highest number of community conservancies, and this presents an opportunity to examine the role of communities in conservation of endangered species.\n3. Lake Nakuru National Park, in Rift Valley is the first protected area in Kenya to be completely fenced due to massive human development and land use changes in its environs. It?s therefore ecologically an ?island,? but it?s one of the best performing sanctuaries in the country especially for conservation and breeding of Rothschild giraffe, black and white rhino. This presents an opportunity to examine ecological opportunities and challenges of using sanctuaries to enhance recovery and conservation of these endangered species. \nLaikipia landscape in Central Kenya is one of the pillars of wildlife conservation in the country and is home to several endangered species like Africa elephant, lion, cheetah, bongo, grevy zebra, and the African wild dog. The largest populations of black and white rhinos in the country are also found in the region, and it has the second largest population of elephants. In addition, the region has numerous private conservancies which play a major role in wildlife conservation, including conservation of several endangered species. Land tenure in Laikipia is embedded in Kenya?s colonial history and therefore adds a different political debate in the conservation of endangered species.",

    "info": "The tropics are globally known for their abundant natural resources. For instance, more than half of the world's biodiversity is found in tropical forests, which are considered biodiversity hotspots among terrestrial ecosystems (Mittermeier et al., 2011; Pillay et al., 2022). However, in this biogeographic region, increased land use intensification (e.g. industrial agriculture, urban expansion) has resulted in environmental degradation, forest fragmentation, and habitat loss, threatening the long-term functioning of ecosystems and the services they provide (Tabarelli, 2004; Alroy, 2017, de Oliveira et al., 2018). It is critical to implement management strategies that allow for the proper use of natural resources, while also ensuring the equity among the actors involved and maintaining ecosystem functionality. Traditionally, environmental management has assumed that natural resources are static systems, so human intervention must be regulated to maintain their stability. Given the global scale of environmental problems (e.g. climate change), this approach may be unrealistic. As an alternative natural resource managers have proposed new theories based on the concept of resilience (Benson & Garmestani, 2011). Resilience can be defined as the system?s ability to absorb internal and/or external change and recover while maintaining long-term functionality (Holling 1973; Benson & Garmestani, 2011). Thus, management of natural resources can focus on identifying key aspects of ecosystems that contribute to their resilience, while also acknowledging the possibility for change and providing a framework for developing adaptive capacity in social and ecological systems (Gunderson et al., 2010). While this approach provides new ways of thinking about social and ecological systems, it also implies modifications to the legal framework and management strategies that are already implemented, which can be challenging, especially in tropical countries such as Costa Rica.\n\nThis inter-disciplinary course focuses on principles and applications of natural resources management, exploring alternative ways to ensure equity among the stakeholders involved in the use of these resources, while sustaining social and ecological resilience. The course will introduce the challenges faced by managers of natural resources at the global level, with emphasis on Costa Rica, within the context of a fragmented landscape, agriculture, and urban expansion. Based on specific case studies, illustrated during classes and field trips, the course will show concepts and tools used for addressing complex environmental issues such as mammal conservation, solid waste management, and water management problems.\n\nSee course syllabus for full course description.",

    "info": "Globally, most natural resources face enormous pressure from multiple direct and indirect  human activities, with delirious consequences for humans and natural life. Further, most of the  resources are limited, and thus easily prone to any disturbance by humans. In this regard, a lot  of effort has gone to promote sustainable utilization of natural resources with emphasis on  minimizing damaging human activities and overexploitation. Most parts of East Africa, Kenya  included are dominated by Savanna or rangeland environments which are naturally dry for most  of the year due to scanty annual rainfall. However, these are the same landscapes where diverse biota endowments are found but which are currently under siege and near extermination by  rapid human population growth and unregulated land-use changes.  \nThe Amboseli Ecosystem is characterized by a semi-arid environment, and rainfall is received  twice a year but it’s scarce, unpredictable and low (300-800mm per year). This creates a water  deficient landscape, and most of the water is found in scattered rivers, streams, springs, and  wetlands like swamps, all linked to the hydrology of the neighboring Mt. Kilimanjaro. These  conditions tend to favour wildlife conservation and pastoralism, the latter being the historical key land use by the local pastoral Maasai people. However, immigration into the region by  agricultural communities starting in the 1960 through the 1980s saw introduction of farming as  a new land use along the wet and arable slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro along the Kenya-Tanzania border. Thereafter, irrigated agriculture mostly for commercial purposes was introduced in the  water systems of the Maasai Group Ranches where rain-fed farming is not possible. This lifestyle  shift has seen pastoralism nearly replaced and dominated by agro-pastoralism among the  Maasai.  \nToday, the dominant human activities, mostly irrigated farming and livestock in the Maasai group  ranches and the former Kimana Group Ranch keeping rely on the springs and rivers emanating  from Mt. Kilimanjaro. The wildlife ecological dynamics in the ecosystem is also entirely  dependent on these wetlands, which are the predominant dry season concentration areas as  water and forage resources elsewhere diminish. Consequently, management of water resources  is a major conservation and livelihood issue. Often there are conflicts associated with water use  among humans and between humans and wildlife, which is attributed to diminished availability  of this vital resource. Resolving these conflicts and promoting wise use of available water  resources is a major preoccupation of wildlife and natural resources managers in the area, Water  Resource Users Associations (WRUAs) and the Water Resources Authority (WRA), the lead Kenya Government agency on water management.  \nThe Amboseli Ecosystem lies contiguous to the Tsavo West and Chyulu Hills National Parks which are part of the Tsavo Conservation Area, the largest wildlife conservation landscape in Kenya. Chyulu Hills was gazetted as a protected area in 1983 to enhance protection of its wildlife  resources and watershed services. It’s recognized as one of the important water catchment areas  situated in the dry lands of the country and provides water to a vast landscape and diverse  beneficiaries including Mombasa County. However, this service is threatened by destruction and \ngeneral environmental degradation of the hills by livestock grazing, charcoal burning, and accidental fires. Neighboring the Chyulu Hills N. Park is the expansive Tsavo West N. Park, which  covers more than 9,000Km, and it’s one of the important wildlife conservation areas in the  country. Prior to its gazettement as a protected area in 1948, the area was used by pastoral  communities like the Maasai. Over the years, human population and land use changes especially farming, adjust the park boundaries have increased significantly. This has led to escalation of human-wildlife..",

    "title": "Endangered Species Conservatn",
    "info": "Conservation and management efforts in resource management dates back in 19th century with utilitarian principles. Utilitarian conservation advocated for renewable resources that were to be managed in a way that they are not to be exhausted. Species diversity in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem comprise the majority of the living organisms. We are faced with large contemporary extinction of species, degradation of ecosystems, fragmentation of remaining indigenous vegetation and uncertain fates for many species. It is worth noting that resources that are available to conserve\nbiodiversity must be utilized efficiently. Efficient management is particularly important because current utilization is estimated to be insufficient to conserve the world?s biodiversity.\n\nConservation and management decisions are required for many different circumstances, such as decisions about whether species should be listed as threatened, choosing from a set of management strategies for those species, allocating resources such as land, supplemental feeds, or permitting development. Determining search effort for threatened species requires knowledge about the system being managed, the efficacy of actions, and constraints.\n\nManagement of threatened and endangered species requires decision making in the face of uncertainty. Foremost, understand the decision context of threatened species management and understand how to make decisions when we do not know everything about them. Effective conservation management relies on managers and conservationists specifying the goals, the threats and opportunities, and alternatives set of management actions available and how they influence vulnerable and endangered species conservation. The overall goal of the Endangered species conservation course will be to provide students with in-depth understanding on the landscape dynamics of East Africa Savanna Ecosystems and their contribution on vulnerability of wildlife species. It will develop interest in and bring an understanding of\nthe management and conservation efforts regionally and in Kenya, and how Kenya has exerted its conservation efforts in conservation of vulnerable species. Students will have a chance to learn and apply field techniques and approaches to assess and monitor different species that have been classified as vulnerable. A comparative approach to different management systems will be used to determine the effectiveness of species management locally, regionally, and globally. Students will practice the\nclassification criteria for species in the ecosystem. Aspects learned on the course will also be applied to meet the needs and objectives of the Directed Research. ",

    "info": "The clearing of the world?s forests has created habitat fragmentation and caused a considerable number of species extinctions. Increasingly fragmented populations succumb to the demographic and genetic consequences associated with small population sizes. It is estimated that between 3,000 and 30,000 species are going extinct every year based on rates of forest habitat loss and estimates of global biodiversity. This is particularly true for tropical regions where biodiversity is highest. The drivers of forest loss are complex and operate across a variety of geographic and socio-political scales. In addition, the ongoing global climate change is altering the phenology of many species and inducing shifts in species geographic range. These ecological alterations act synergistically with other anthropogenic factors (e.g., hunting, urban development, pollution, etc.) thus accelerating the rate of species extinction. Therefore, it is critical for tropical communities to be resilient to those changes, and adapt to the Anthropocene; we also need to analyze those examples of success or understand what factors facilitate the healing of natural systems. \n\nDeveloping countries have different development models that directly or indirectly affect the environment, biodiversity, and ecosystem services. Costa Rica took a major shift from an agriculture-based economy to a service-based, environmentally-friendly economy. For instance, the ecotourism industry is supported by a network of protected areas that form the national system of conservation areas. However, the downside of ecotourism development brings an increase in infrastructure, such as roads and\nresorts that cause environmental alteration. In addition, emerging diseases, invasive species, biodiversity loss, and climate change are modifying the communities of organisms in tropical areas as Costa Rica. Our next goal is not just understanding the level of those affectations but to monitor how tropical ecosystems can be resilient to those rapid changes. Many of these negative impacts can be avoided or mitigated, or resilience-regeneration processes can be facilitated, if the necessary knowledge of the interacting ecological processes and human activities is acquired.\n\nModern science, including conservation biology and applied ecology, is a multidisciplinary effort with a significant social impact. The construction of a sustainable future and resilient ecosystems will depend on a multidisciplinary approach to understand and solve conservation problems. This understanding ought to be based on solid ecological information, especially in tropical ecosystems where the diversity of life forms and biological interactions are complex, and where social and economic challenges are daunting. Thus, in order to have an understanding of the current ecological problems and to look for potential solutions to those problems, we will study the main following themes: a) tropical forest dynamics, b) the origin of tropical diversity, c) mechanism of species extinction, d) assessment and use of biodiversity, e) ecosystem dynamics and human-initiated disturbances (ecological consequences of infrastructures and forest fragmentation), f) climate change and tropical forest dynamics, g) the ecology of emerging diseases and invasive species, e) panarchy applied to ecosystem resilience and circular economy. We will do this through lectures, group discussions, field trips, and field research. In this integrated multidisciplinary program, the students will examine the negative impacts of development on the ecosystems in various parts of Costa Rica and Panama and evaluate cases of effective conservation and management practices.",

We will explore ecological succession, including primary succession, which is how life recruits into new environments, such as bare rock after glacial retreat, or new, igneous rock after volcanic eruption. Though flora is not particularly diverse here in southern Patagonia (save for the lichens and bryophytes), the floral structural complexity is fascinating.\nWe will explore a remarkable latitudinal gradient—from Cape Horn in the south to Chiloé Island’s milder, temperate climate—a latitudinal change equivalent to traveling from Massachusetts to Florida. Thematically, we will traverse alpine ecology, exposed terrestrial ecology, coastal ecology, marine ecology, and fire ecology. From the central focus on the theory and practice of ecology, we will expand to investigate relationships between people and nature in conservation, resilience, and environmental challenges. We will explore the role of protected areas in conservation, including private protected areas that have emerged in Chile; invasive species; human history on landscapes; agriculture, plantation forests, and aquaculture; and current and predicted changes due to climate change.\nThe course is constructed so that the lens of climate shifts and perturbations will be central to discussions and observations; it will encompass not only climate threats, but an understanding of the role of nature in climate adaptation and mitigation, and the role of Chilean climate policy and commitments in an international community.",

We will examine the connection between postcolonial practices and current development strategies to better understand Costa Rica?s efforts to protect people?s rights while honoring the rights of nature.\n\nThis course assesses community attempts to resist existing structural and institutional arrangements and encourage social change to better meet human needs in balance with the environment. We will see how groups create accountability through grassroots knowledge and power in Costa Rica, locating theory in concrete examples. We will analyze key themes of resilience-building including indigenous land rights struggles, agroecological production, seed sovereignty, and agrotourism.\n\nWorking with community stakeholders, students will conduct first-hand analysis of social issues. They will develop skills essential to future advocacy, community organization and the insights necessary for social change. Projects will examine the significance of social research in struggles for social justice. Field experiences in this course include working with indigenous communities, regenerative farmers, and communities tackling waste management issues. Students will conduct quantitative and qualitative research to prepare written, oral, and visual presentations that reflect their understanding of justice and social change. This fieldwork will prepare students for a final directed research project on the intersection of social and environmental justice challenges.",

    "info": "This course aims to provide students with critical thinking tools to examine environmental problems and acknowledge that political circumstances are the foremost driver. This course will identify underlying conditions for many current and previous socio-environmental crises and the leading research-driven approaches in political ecology. Political ecology (PE) is not a discipline per se but an interdisciplinary field that enhances our understanding of complex environmental situations. Thus, PE is as complex as our relationship with nature.Political ecology in recent years has become a relevant strategy to include politics in an apolitical context. Consequently, social and natural environment/conservation issues are brought together in a political context?conservation governance, protected areas, and community-based natural resource management. Moreover, it is a field of critical research. Political ecology research broadens the perspective of an environmental crisis/situation and focuses on the study of interdependence among political units and their environment. Therefore, this course will revisit concepts and debates about power inequality, production systems, knowledge, and discourse. PE focuses on how previous economic/political events influenced contemporary environmental crises. Additionally, this course will provide an overview of the most common methods in anthropology used by political ecologists. These methods will demonstrate the interdisciplinary nature of political ecology and the capacity to draw upon other fields to address its research questions. By the end of this course, the students will be able to provide solid arguments for why the Andes-Amazon region is a political space. They will be able to identify political circumstances shaping the current landscape and internalize that conservation is a dynamic and complex system. Students will recognize that politics, within its distinct scales, is the primary driver of ecological transformations. This course will complement its content and learning objectives from other courses dictated during the semester, such as Tropical Ecology, Conservation Science, and Culture and Language.",

Though the SFS model emphasizes field-based methodologies, there is much to be learned in those aspects of research that lie beyond the fieldwork: building a robust question, vetting sources of information to produce a high-quality literature review, placing novel inquiry within a theoretical and empirical context and analyzing existing data to create a strong discussion of the research question. \nThe aim of this course is to provide students the opportunity to explore existing Center resources and develop methods of inquiry to analyze environmental issues relevant to the communities in which we operate. We will investigate the ways that various methods and theories distinguish (or not) fact from interpretation, cause from correlation, and advocacy from objectivity. Through their research projects, students will contribute to a growing body of scientific research that informs local conservation and resource management decisions near SFS Centers around the world.\nEach student will be led by a faculty advisor that will produce research questions and methods, analyze data, and communicate results in one or across several of the following disciplines: ecology, conservation, earth sciences, natural resource management, anthropology, human geography, and environmental policy. All FEI projects are collaborative in process, but individual in outputs. Depending on the project, students may work together on the development and analysis of questions, but individual students must submit final assignments independently. The course is designed to build on the information students have learned in their disciplinary courses at each Center.  In addition, faculty will provide lectures and workshops specifically designed to assist students in understanding the scientific process and presenting results in both written, spoken, and visual formats.
