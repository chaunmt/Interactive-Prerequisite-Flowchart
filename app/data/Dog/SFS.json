",
    "prereqInfo": "high-latitude regions, such as patagonia, are often more prone to the effects of climate change, making changes more apparent and significant. indeed, climate change in patagonia is quite clear, and one of  the seasons that have seen the most marked change is the winter. there has been less precipitation, and higher temperatures, meaning that there is less overall precipitation, and that which falls tends  more to be rain. this is leading to changes in ecological and social contexts of the patagonian winter that  we will explore in this course.
