But the sea was not just a theatre of war, it was also a lively economic area, with trade routes crossing it from north to south, from east to west. Moreover, it was the place where different cultures met: This course will explore their reciprocal influence, with a special focus on art history and a mainly Italian and Florentine point of view. Topics will include: the impact of Islamic art on Western culture; the role of Byzantine art in the development of Florentine painting; the rediscovery of Greek classical culture and its importance in Renaissance civilization; the consequences of the fall of Constantinople and of the expansion of the Ottoman Empire. Students will explore Florentine churches, palaces, and museums in search of visual evidence of the links between the city and the diversity of Mediterranean culture.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":{"course":[]}},{"code":"FLOR 3014","subject":"FLOR","id":"3014","title":"Fashion & Arts Communication","info":"This course was structured out of four core ideas: how fashion designers and artists communicate and market their art; how institutions communicate and market the fashion items and artworks they have on display; how the audience communicates their experience of fashion and of art and how this influences marketing and promotional strategies; and how these three processes are implemented through communication and marketing channels and for which purposes. The course will explore its core ideas integrating theoretical and experiential-learning approaches.","prereqInfo":"Starting from the fundamentals of communication theory, with a focus on listening skills and effective storytelling, students will draw from case studies to understand the underlying core of communication activities in fashion and the arts.

After an introduction to different definitions of identity, with a particular focus on the formation, maintenance, and evolution of group identity through cultural practices, the course will analyze the history and culture of food in different civilizations of the Mediterranean basin: Phoenicians, Ancient Hebrews, Greco-Romans, and others. Study of the different diets of the Byzantines and the Venetian merchants, and the influence of the spice trade and nascent Islam during the Middle Ages, will show how identities are formed, consolidated, and changed through food. The Renaissance, especially in Florence, will be the object of an in-depth analysis as a pivotal time in Western food culture and in the arts. The course will then investigate the relationship between Florentine and French elite identities via the birth of modern table manners (and dishes) and their connection with the rise of the first nation states. The last part of the course will consider modern states, migration, and how these interconnect with agricultural practices and industrial food processes that have changed the nature of food production in the Mediterranean.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":{"course":[]}},{"code":"FLOR 3016","subject":"FLOR","id":"3016","title":"Photography for Social Media","info":"This course introduces students to the principles of photography for social media and how essential it is to learn about storytelling.
