great civilizations clashed for the control of the mediterranean basin: the latin west, the byzantine empire, and the muslim world. but the sea was not just a theatre of war, it was also a lively economic area, with trade routes crossing it from north to south, from east to west. moreover, it was the place where different cultures met: this course will explore their reciprocal influence, with a special focus on art history and a mainly italian and florentine point of view. topics will include: the impact of islamic art on western culture; the role of byzantine art in the development of florentine painting; the rediscovery of greek classical culture and its importance in renaissance civilization; the consequences of the fall of constantinople and of the expansion of the ottoman empire. students will explore florentine churches, palaces, and museums in search of visual evidence of the links between the city and the diversity of mediterranean culture.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"FLOR 3014","subject":"FLOR","id":"3014","title":"Fashion & Arts Communication","info":"this course was structured out of four core ideas: how fashion designers and artists communicate and market their art; how institutions communicate and market the fashion items and artworks they have on display; how the audience communicates their experience of fashion and of art and how this influences marketing and promotional strategies; and how these three processes are implemented through communication and marketing channels and for which purposes. the course will explore its core ideas integrating theoretical and experiential-learning approaches.\n\nstarting from the fundamentals of communication theory, with a focus on listening skills and effective storytelling, students will draw from case studies to understand the underlying core of communication activities in fashion and the arts. the promotional process in both industries will be analyzed in its main parts (research, planning, execution, evaluation), as well as in its ethical and legal implications.\n\nstudents will experiment with promotional tools to understand the connection between public relations and the media, and explore the blurred line between public relations and marketing when dealing with social media contents and strategic planning. ultimately, they will learn the fundamentals to develop and design a communication campaign.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"FLOR 3015","subject":"FLOR","id":"3015","title":"Hist. of Food/Identity in Med.","info":"this course is an investigation into how the identities of different peoples in the mediterranean can be understood through the lens of the food they cultivate, trade, and eat. after an introduction to different definitions of identity, with a particular focus on the formation, maintenance, and evolution of group identity through cultural practices, the course will analyze the history and culture of food in different civilizations of the mediterranean basin: phoenicians, ancient hebrews, greco-romans, and others. study of the different diets of the byzantines and the venetian merchants, and the influence of the spice trade and nascent islam during the middle ages, will show how identities are formed, consolidated, and changed through food. the renaissance, especially in florence, will be the object of an in-depth analysis as a pivotal time in western food culture and in the arts. the course will then investigate the relationship between florentine and french elite identities via the birth of modern table manners (and dishes) and their connection with the rise of the first nation states. the last part of the course will consider modern states, migration, and how these interconnect with agricultural practices and industrial food processes that have changed the nature of food production in the mediterranean.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"FLOR 3016","subject":"FLOR","id":"3016","title":"Photography for Social Media","info":"this course introduces students to the principles of

audiences?\nthe course will appeal to students majoring in communication, marketing, design, journalism, and sociology and to all students interested in learning practical skills in photography, including compositional and technical information about apps, smartphone settings, and gear. there will also be time dedicated to analyzing social media impact on data, privacy, image protection, and intellectual property. this is not a social media marketing course but is designed as a creative exploration that will help students develop their eye for exciting imagery and improve their shooting skills.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"FLOR 3017W","subject":"FLOR","id":"3017W","title":"The Traveling Self","info":"“i did not then represent to myself towns, landscapes, monuments, as pictures more or less attractive, cut out here and there of a substance that was common to them all, but looked on each of them as on an unknown thing, essentially different from all the rest, a thing for which my soul thirsted and which it would benefit from knowing.”\n(marcel proust, swann’s way. in search of lost time. volume 1)\n\n“what i write about myself is never the last word: the more ‘sincere’ i am, the more interpretable i am.”\n(r. barthes, roland barthes by roland barthes, trans. r. howard, mcmillan, london 1977)\n\ntravel experience in italy has been for centuries an inspirational path for writers, novelists, and journalists from all over the world. the deep history and the most significant places in this relevant european country—connected both to the northern cultures and at the crossroads with the mediterranean ones—has prompted new narrative strategies, peculiar fictional characters, and innovative plots. authors have been travelling the country by different means of transportation—carriages, trains, but also on foot—that have influenced their perspectives. they have walked into churches, squares, gardens, and museums to explore a flourishing collection of symbols and values from the past and to foresee the complexity of the future of western civilization. they have tasted delicious and repellent flavors in italian markets, shops, and restaurants and discussed italian society and its issues. they have changed their personal mindsets, exploring new maps of their own cultural identity.\n\ntraveling abroad has always been, in fact, an experience of enrichment, enhancement, and transformation of a traveler’s identity and intimate self. starting from this assumption, this creative writing course will use the narrative strategies offered by modern and contemporary autobiography to draw inspiration from the students’ italian and european travel experience. at the same time, a “classic” field in literature and a flourishing contemporary trend, the genre of autobiography defies categories. it allows us to experiment with innovative forms—from diary to travelogue, from literary nonfiction to the so-called “autofiction”—that are also currently evolving under the influence of the social networks and the possibilities of augmented experience offered by the web.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"FLOR 3040","subject":"FLOR","id":"3040","title":"Impact of Globaliz'n-Euro Mkts","info":"theoretical analysis of international
