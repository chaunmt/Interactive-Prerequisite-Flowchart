In this way, we bring together interdisciplinary and intercultural learning.  On the dates that we meet virtually, our goal is to create a space that encourages us to share with sincerity our thoughts and emerging insights with one another in Zoom conversations.

Living systems (including social, biological, and environmental) are complex adaptive systems that are self-organizing and give rise to emergent properties within a wider “ecosystemic” context. To effect beneficial and sustainable changes within such systems, leaders must apply (and embody) ecosystemic principles. This course will help students learn how to understand—and to effect sustainable change in—the complex systems in their lives: personal, social, and environmental. Students will explore and develop leadership strategies and skills, using complexity theory as a theoretical framework. \n\nWe are facing a multifaceted global/planetary crisis. The evidence is clear that Global Climate Change is primarily driven by human behaviors. Drawing upon the new science of Complex Systems, it is also evident that human social systems (economic, political, and cultural) are impelling us towards a planetary “bifurcation point.” Our only hope to avoid multiple systems collapse is to make deep changes in these systems. Rigid, top-down approaches based on linear and mechanistic paradigms are ill-suited to transformative leadership, which facilitates an open-ended process of organic change.

This course is designed to provide a basic understanding of the central elements of forgiveness and healing in the context of multiple micro and macro life settings.\n\nThe concepts of forgiveness and healing will be examined from multiple spiritual and secular traditions. The underlying philosophical elements of forgiveness and healing will be critically assessed and beliefs and rituals from numerous indigenous and European traditions will be presented and examined. The focus will be upon gaining a more grounded understanding of the process of forgiveness and its potential impact upon emotional and relational healing. The concepts of forgiveness and healing will be addressed in a very broad and inclusive manner, with no assumptions made related to their specific cultural context or meaning. Empirical studies that have examined the impact of forgiveness upon emotional and physical healing will be reviewed.\n\nConcepts such as forgiveness and healing are inseparable from the concept of spirituality. For the purposes of the course, spirituality is not synonymous with the dogma and creeds of the major religious traditions in the world, even though religion for many may serve as a pathway to spirituality. Practices within the major religions of the world that foster forgiveness and healing, however, will be explored, along with practices within Native American, Canadian Aboriginal, Native Hawaiian, African, New Zealand Maori, and Eastern cultural traditions.\n\nprereq: Jr or sr or grad student or instr consent",

        "info": "This course will cover the evidence regarding effectiveness and safety of CIH practices, and the relationship of CIH to contemporary views of pain, health, and healing. There is a growing evidence base to support some complementary and integrative healing (CIH) approaches for pain management including yoga, mindfulness meditation, chiropractic, and others. In the US, chronic pain impacts over one third of the population and affects more individuals than heart disease, diabetes, and cancer combined. While there is a wide range of conventional medical treatments available to manage pain, many are only marginally effective and are associated with troublesome side effects. Of growing concerns is the endemic problem of opioids associated with misuse, addiction, and fatal overdose. Pain sufferers and health providers need effective and safe options for pain management. Some complementary and integrative healing (CIH) approaches have a growing evidence base to support their use, particularly for pain management. This course will introduce students to the theories, mechanisms, use, effectiveness, and safety of commonly used complementary and integrative healing practices. The relationship of CIH approaches to contemporary views and research regarding pain, health and healing, and placebo effects will also be explored. Through reading, reflection, discussion, and critical appraisal, students will develop the necessary skills to synthesize different forms of information, including research, to reach evidence-informed and balanced conclusions regarding CIH for managing pain, restoring function, and enhancing overall health and wellbeing. CIH approaches covered will include: whole systems (Traditional Chinese Medicine, osteopathy, chiropractic, Ayurvedic Medicine, etc.); mind-body practices (contemplative and meditative practices; yoga, tai chi, Qigong, etc.); manipulative and body-based approaches (massage therapy, acupuncture, manipulation); and energy-based approaches (energy medicine, Reiki, therapeutic touch, healing touch). Upon completion of the course, students will have a foundational knowledge of CIH for pain management and the skills to critically appraise and determine the trustworthiness of different information sources. \n\nPrerequisite: Graduate or Professional program student.

Students will explore and practice risk-benefit profiles of different modalities in the context of evidence-based mental health care. An emphasis will be placed on the connection between physical and mental health and how that can be approached from an integrative perspective. Topics such as mindfulness and mental health, nutrition and mental health, herbs and supplements in psychiatric care, and the role of functional medicine in IMH will be covered, as well as how psychotherapy and psychotropic medications fit in the IMH framework. Students will review the current diagnostic system for mental health disorders and that can both help and hinder an integrative approach to mental health care. Integrative approaches for assessing mental health concerns will be reviewed, and how to use these approaches alongside a traditional medical approach for maximum benefit will be explored. Students will further review specific modalities for mental health and wellbeing that are less focused on specific systems and more focused on holism and the interplay of systems.  Students will also identity and explore different ways of viewing mental health and wellbeing based on cultural and geographical issues, and how these may impact the approaches. \n",
