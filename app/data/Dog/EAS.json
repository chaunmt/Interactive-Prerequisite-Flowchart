    "title": "Intro to Imperialism in Asia",
    "info": "Organized around a series of themes, this course will begin with a broad overview of imperialism in Asia before diving into economics of empire, technologies of imperialism, race and gender, nationalism and the end of empire, and neocolonialism. Throughout, the class will center the history of present-day China, India, Southeast Asia, and Japan, emphasizing whenever possible the perspectives of those impacted by empire rather than those perpetuating it. As such, assigned readings focus on primary sources supplemented by relevant secondary research, with optional readings providing significant breadth and depth for interested students seeking to delve further into their own interests or find new avenues of scholarly inquiry. All told, the histories included here represent some of the most significant events in recent centuries, but ones that often go overlooked in an academic context, covered only as a footnote in the histories of the West. Instead, this course will center the history of Asia and the voices of those impacted by imperialism, offering new perspectives on some of the most significant moments that shaped-and continue to shape-our contemporary world. \n\nDesigned as an introductory course for those unfamiliar with the history of Asia, this class approaches a broad geographic and temporal range through case studies, diving deeply into crucial historical moments rather than providing an exhaustive overview of more than two centuries of Western imperialism. Simultaneously, this class will introduce students to the process of historical analysis itself using a substantial focus on primary sources, instructional time spent in libraries and archives, and a well-supported, intensive research essay process as a way to encourage them to think critically about the historical project while also honing their own historiographical skills. Overall, students will leave this course with a strong foundation in the history of Asia and the history of Western imperialism along with real practice doing history, preparing them for their future within the Department of History, at the University of Minnesota, and beyond.
