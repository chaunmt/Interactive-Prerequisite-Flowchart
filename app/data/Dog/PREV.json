    "info": "This course is intended to provide students with broad exposure to topics in research methodology within the field of prevention science. Prevention science as a discipline focuses on the etiology and prevention of social, physical and mental health problems and the translation of that information to promote health and well-being. This course will emphasize research methodology as it pertains to preventive interventions in youth and family contexts. The course is intended to serve as a survey of a wide range of topics within these areas, with research design, measurement issues, and analytic methods representing the major foci. Topics will be covered with attention to the community contexts within which prevention research often occurs as well as the ethical and human subjects issues that may arise. Students who successfully complete the course are expected to be able to interpret and critically evaluate prevention research methodology as well as identify appropriate methodical strategies to address research questions within prevention science",
