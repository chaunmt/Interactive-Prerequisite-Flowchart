to tap into the curiosities we all have about our bodies by providing you with a foundational understanding of how your body works. the goal of this course is for you to learn about the human body and how it functions when it is both healthy and when things break down. in the classroom setting, we will focus on understanding the functions of each major organ system from the heart to the brain. then in the lab, each of you will have the opportunity to see and touch real human organs you just learned about in class. additionally, in this course, you will compare both healthy and diseased human tissue to better understand how choices you make every day can affect your organ's structure and function. when you leave this course, you will leave empowered, not only by your understanding of your
