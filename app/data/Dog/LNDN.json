(we understand “cinema” here broadly to refer to the production and dissemination of moving pictures, and cinema to be a form of mass media that is inherently inter-medial.) it will explore different forms of this cinema (documentary, experimental, propagandistic, fictional) and lead us to examine the politics of form across history. it will explore the writings of cultural activists and academics as they examine questions about media, power, and influence. it will produce knowledge about past political struggles as mediated through film (and push us to learn about the socio-political contexts in which the films were made and circulated). plus it will necessarily prompt questions about how different state systems engage with media and how the production and regulation of media are political acts that shape the possible public sphere. in pursuing these lines of enquiry our work will necessarily be interdisciplinary, and we will draw in particular (but not exclusively) from scholarship in political history and political science, public policy, film, media, and cultural studies, history, and broadly progressive traditions of historical, cultural, and media analysis. the class contributes to larger curricular goals in various ways: it explores the international history of cinema, in its political contexts in particular, draws on concepts across the humanities and social science of use to the study of cinema, and it will encourage and foster the production of scholarly work that clearly and coherently addresses issues important to the study of cinema and the modern world.",

    "info": "the year 2020 saw america and most of the world convulsed by two major events: the global health pandemic of the covid-19 virus, which was worldwide in scope; and the spontaneous spread of protests for racial justice in america and many other countries in the democratic world that were triggered by the killing of george floyd by police in the city of minneapolis.\n\nboth these events, coming as disrupting forces to the established political and economic order, underscore longstanding questions for political, economic, and philosophical debate: where should power and decision-making take place? is human nature noble, but enchained by corrupted institutions or is it brutish and violent, requiring a social contract with an authority to safeguard the rights of all? if we accept the second proposition, who guards the guards?\n\nthe tensions between national and supra-national governance, exemplified by the us withdrawal from the world health organisation, appear to echo the trend to increasing nationalism, autonomy and populism that influenced the uk decision on brexit (britain exiting the european union). the organic and viral movement of activism in support of black lives matter may share some of the characteristics of extinction rebellion inasmuch as the concerns for immediate action on racial injustice, the climate crisis, and other issues, have seen large numbers of people, including a significant proportion of the youth demographic, take to the streets, and mobilise for direct action for social change.\n\nthis course will explore historic, recent, and contemporary trends in the political authority invested in the nation-state and its agencies and contrast this with social and political forces expressing discontent with the status quo. one section of the syllabus will examine ideas for greater global governance, such as the league of nations, the un, and new bodies such as the international criminal court. the second section of the syllabus will explore ideas for local autonomy, and radical action on such matters as policing, systemic racism, carbon consumption, the rising use of surveillance technology, and the free-market assumptions that underpin western societies. other modules in the course will examine the phenomenon that has been labelled “populism” and the discontent with current form of globalization, both from the political right and the political left. a further module will explore the fragmentation of the west-centric global order in light of an increasing multipolar world and the rising economic and political dynamism of china.",

    "info": "for decades now, news stories have brought to public attention the countless social and ethical issues raised by the operations of all kinds of businesses.  the latest wave of criticism began with the rash of scandals first brought to light in late 2001, when the enron fraud was exposed: the enron debacle was an ethical tsunami that redefined business’s relationships with society and the global community. since then, other corporate names have been publicly shamed: martha stewart, rite aid, imclone, healthsouth, worldcom, global crossing, microsoft, monsanto, wal-mart, facebook, tyco, adelphia, boeing, and many others. the global economic crisis that began in 2008 has added also banks, financial operators, and insurances to the list of ethically controversial business actors. in general, companies must today grapple with highly complex and vast societal concerns that far exceed the pursuit of a satisfactory bottom line—and do so in a globalized, highly interconnected, instantly informed, and socially conscious environment.\n\nwe will discuss the role of business in society, and whether business without ethics can be sustained in a world characterized by great economic uncertainty, financial insecurity, dramatic levels of inequality both within and among countries, fast-paced technological progress, stratified and sometimes contradictory legal requirements, weak global institutions, and a rampant environmental crisis.  \n\nbusiness ethics raises questions about a host of widely diverse issues: executive powers, corporate governance, covert monopolies, delocalized production and outsourced labor, unmet or distorted health standards, the commercial implications of genetic research, the patents and copyrights regime, the accountability of financial institutions, businesses’ employment of political action committees to influence the outcome of legislation - along with the macro-themes of galloping technological development and the overall sustainability - ecological, economic, and social - of current production and consumption patterns.",
