Writing is crucial to the field because the only way for a nonprofit to be awarded a grant is by submitting a written proposal. The strength of the proposal has a significant impact on the money that an organization will receive. Students will become familiar with various sections of the proposal by drafting, editing, and seeking feedback, and by revising a needs assessment, goal statement, budget justification, and statement of organizational purpose. By learning how to write well in the field, students will increase their chances of being employed by a nonprofit and securing funding for their organization.",
