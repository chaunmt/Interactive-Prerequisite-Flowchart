Students will be taught how to construct and numerically solve Lagrangian particle tracking models with one-way coupling and will be provided with codes to compute the free molecular drag force on particles of arbitrary shape (IMoS).  In the second section, the course will discuss dense dispersed media, including effective medium approximations to describe thermal and electrical transport in complex systems, an introduction to foams and unit cells, flow in porous media, and granular systems (four-way coupled systems).  In the third section, the course will return to dilute systems, but wherein the dispersed phase is deformable (droplets).  Topics will include droplet behavior on a surface (wetting and line tension), an introduction to emulsions, droplet-droplet coalescence, and atomization processes.  The fourth and final section of the course, phase change and multiphase system formation will be introduced, including the kinetics of nucleation of condensed phase material in a gas, as well as solid (ice) formation in a liquid.  The overarching goal of the course is to prepare PhD and MS students to be able to address research level questions experimentally, numerically, and theoretically in their studies beyond the course.\n",

The course is hands-on and follows a learn by doing approach. Students spend 1/3 the course in a microcontroller boot camp and 2/3 on a substantial microcontroller project. The lectures cover didactic material related to microcontrollers, sensors, actuators, electronics circuit design and fabrication and control algorithm implementation.",

The vehicle application topics studied include cruise control, adaptive cruise control, automated lane keeping, automated highway systems, yaw stability control, active rollover prevention, engine control, and active and semi-active suspensions. In each application, a dynamic model is first developed that is simple enough for control system design, but at the same time, rich enough for capturing the essential features of the dynamics. The control design for each application is studied in-depth during lecture and further analyzed during hands-on homework.",
