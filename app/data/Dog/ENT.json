Did you know these are in part insect related questions? Insects make up more than half of the living organisms on this planet, and they have had a profound impact in shaping human society and culture. Even so, insects are swatted, stomped, squished, and otherwise misunderstood. In this course students will explore the complex, and often uncomfortable, relationships between insects and humans and explore the ethical dilemmas posed by our close relationships with the insect world. Ultimately this course examines the interactions between insects and humans, focusing on contemporary topics that explore how insects dictate human actions, policies, and behaviors. Topics include: human perception of insects; basic concepts in insect biology and behavior; environmental and cultural importance of insects; the role of insect pests in determining human food choice; insect vectors and disease transmission; perception and awareness about humanity’s role in nature.","prereq":[]},{"code":"ENT 1004","subject":"ENT","id":"1004","title":"The Insects","info":"Insects represent one of the most abundant and diverse life forms on Earth, and their environmental importance is displayed across both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.

These are just a few examples of the extraordinary abilities that invertebrate animals display, reflecting the mighty power of their miniature brains and nervous systems.\nIn this course, we will discuss the fascinating behaviors of animals with miniature brains and how their numerally-limited nervous systems enable them to do what they do.  We will also explore how a deeper understanding of small-brain networks can inform us about how our own brains work, and how such knowledge can be used to engineer adaptive robots, cyborgs and smart machines. This course is designed to be integrative—including disciplines intersecting with animal behavior, entomology, evolution, ecology, neuroscience, psychology and bioengineering.  A major goal of this course is to widen one’s view of the importance of invertebrate animals in the field of neuroscience and gain an appreciation of the translational impact that this knowledge can have and will continue to have on our society and daily lives.

Who are the strongest and fastest athletes in the world? Who fought in a battle that involved billions of participants and left millions dead each month? And who is responsible for the most damaging biological warfare attack in history? The answer is around us every day, and beneath our very feet - INSECTS! \n\nInsects and their relatives have been on planet earth for millions of years, and have evolved an amazing range of weapons and strategies for combating their enemies, defending territories, fighting for mates, and guarding their offspring. Using incredible endurance, strength, and cooperation, insects provide an ideal template for warriors. From stag beetles dueling for mates to supercolonies of Argentine ants warring across California, insects truly are impressive combatants and athletes.\n\nBut more than just fighting each other, insects have also been made into weapons. Throughout history, insects have been used in human warfare to frighten, incapacitate, and sometimes outright destroy armies or populations. During the crusades, beehives thrown over the walls of a city helped lead to a crucial victory, and in the midst of World War II, the Empire of Japan covertly bred millions of insects to spread epidemics amongst their enemies. And in a secret project code named “Operation Big Itch”, the United States prepared to do the same during the Cold War. \n\nIn this course you will learn how and why insects have evolved to be such formidable warriors, and the ways in which they have been used and will continue to be used as weapons of war. From robotic bee spies to termites with a glue gun for a head, insects truly are the most formidable warriors in the world, whether they fight each other, or fight us. \n","prereq":[]},{"code":"ENT 1908","subject":"ENT","id":"1908","title":"Designer Insects","info":"Scientific advances have allowed researchers to “design” organisms through genetic engineering.

Managed insects and their products, such as silks and dyes, have taken their place in world trade; some insects continue to provide high quality products, and are finding new applications through developments in biotechnology and medicine.  Still others are emerging sources of new molecules with therapeutic value. Insect products are used in cosmetics and confectionaries; without a small poorly-known fly, we would not have chocolate. Use of honeybees for pollination on a commercial scale is well-known.  On a smaller scale, insects are produced commercially as biological control agents, and genetically manipulated insects contribute to control of human diseases.  Some species provide food for humans; many more provide food for the pet industry.  Others delight us in butterfly gardens, where easily reared species, some exotic, are released in enclosures.  This course will explore the biology of domesticated insects maintained in managed environments, with emphasis on species that have been cultured by humans for commercial products, pest control, and potential genetic engineering to reduce vector-borne disease.

Through their effects as carriers of disease, insects have decided the outcomes of numerous battles and wars, often causing many more deaths than weapons did.  On the other hand, beneficial insects have made important contributions to the development of many industries, in particular related to textiles and agriculture, and they also serve as important sources of food in many cultures.  Because of their varied and important roles in human life and well-being, insects feature prominently in sacred texts and have thus influenced spiritual and religious thought through the ages.  And from Greek times until the present, insects have contributed greatly to the development of scientific thought.  Many of the great naturalists throughout history – from Aristotle to Darwin to EO Wilson – have had an inordinate fascination with insects.  In the second half of the 20th century and beyond, insects sparked the environmental movement, serve as models for innovating technologies such as robots, and continue to shape our lives in fascinating, challenging and novel ways.  In this class we will discuss the major ways in which the fates of humans and insects have been intertwined over the course of human history.

It involves fascinating interactions between organisms such as plants and herbivores, and insects and the predators and parasitoids that attack them. These interactions can provide spectacular protection from invasive species but risks to the environment are possible as well so biological control interventions must be undertaken with great care. We will explore these interactions and interventions in depth in this class. The class is online.","prereq":[]},{"code":"ENT 5351","subject":"ENT","id":"5351","title":"Insect Pathology","info":"Major pathogenic microorganisms that cause diseases in insects.

In addition, the ability of some invertebrate animals to sense certain stimuli beyond what humans can detect, has enabled scientists to build smart machines and robots with extraordinary capabilities. Since 80% of the world’s species are insects, understanding the basics of how their nervous systems function will enable societies to better manage their health (e.g., helping insect pollinators) or combat their destruction (e.g., preventing locust plagues). Invertebrate Neurobiology is a course that will explore the underlying neural mechanisms that enable animals to solve or respond to particular problems encountered in their natural environments. Many of the invertebrate animals presented will not only exhibit interesting behaviors, but will reveal important and often conserved principles of neuroscience applicable to a host of animals, including us humans. This course is designed to be integrative — including disciplines intersecting with animal behavior, entomology, evolution, ecology, neuroscience, psychology, and bioengineering. A major goal of this course is to widen one’s view of the importance of invertebrate animals in the field of neuroscience and gain an appreciation of the translational impact that this knowledge can have and will continue to have on our society and daily lives. Students will also be introduced to important concepts in neurobiology and learn how small neural networks operate.
