insects are swatted, stomped, squished, and otherwise misunderstood. in this course students will explore the complex, and often uncomfortable, relationships between insects and humans and explore the ethical dilemmas posed by our close relationships with the insect world. ultimately this course examines the interactions between insects and humans, focusing on contemporary topics that explore how insects dictate human actions, policies, and behaviors. topics include: human perception of insects; basic concepts in insect biology and behavior; environmental and cultural importance of insects; the role of insect pests in determining human food choice; insect vectors and disease transmission; perception and awareness about humanity’s role in

of weapons and strategies for combating their enemies, defending territories, fighting for mates, and guarding their offspring. using incredible endurance, strength, and cooperation, insects provide an ideal template for warriors. from stag beetles dueling for mates to supercolonies of argentine ants warring across california, insects truly are impressive combatants and athletes.\n\nbut more than just fighting each other, insects have also been made into weapons. throughout history, insects have been used in human warfare to frighten, incapacitate, and sometimes outright destroy armies or populations. during the crusades, beehives thrown over the walls of a city helped lead to a crucial victory, and in the midst of world war ii, the empire of japan covertly bred millions of insects to spread epidemics amongst their enemies. and in a secret project code named “operation big itch”, the united states prepared to do the same during the cold war. \n\nin this course you will learn how and why insects have evolved to be such formidable warriors, and the ways in which they have been used and will continue to be used as weapons of war. from robotic bee spies to termites with a glue

conventional (nonorganic) and organic approaches, the use of social media and modern technology, and economic, environmental, and social consequences of diverse tactics (chemical, cultural, biological, genetic, etc.) will be covered by the instructor and, on occasion, by guest lecturers. student debates on pesticide-pollinator and genetic engineering issues will provide real-world context and insights on complexities of insect pest prevention and management.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"ENT 5241","subject":"ENT","id":"5241","title":"Ecological Risk

viral, bacterial, protozoan and filarial diseases to humans, particularly in tropical countries.  zika, most recently, and also dengue and other mosquito-borne viruses pose an emerging challenge in the southern us as climate change increases the range of important vector species.  lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases are increasing in the us, and pose challenges in diagnosis and treatment.  this course covers contemporary topics in \\\"medical entomology\\\" that will provide an overview of arthropod-borne disease and its impacts on global health from the perspective of insect vectors and microbial pathogens. students will explore historical, contemporary and epidemiologic stories demonstrating exposure and control strategies via lecture, student discussions, laboratory demonstrations, and critical review of current best practices in medical entomology.  this course is designed for upper division undergraduate and graduate students in any major or minor.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"ENT 5311","subject":"ENT","id":"5311","title":"Sampling Biol Populations","info":"sampling plans for study of field/lab populations. statistical

control is the suppression of pests and weeds using living organisms. it involves fascinating interactions between organisms such as plants and herbivores, and insects and the predators and parasitoids that attack them. these interactions can provide spectacular protection from invasive species but risks to the environment are possible as well so biological control interventions must be undertaken with great care. we will explore these interactions and interventions in depth in this class. the class is online.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"ENT

study of invertebrate animals, such as honey bees, sea slugs, and fruit flies, have been instrumental in informing us humans about how our own brains operate. in addition, the ability of some invertebrate animals to sense certain stimuli beyond what humans can detect, has enabled scientists to build smart machines and robots with extraordinary capabilities. since 80% of the world’s species are insects, understanding the basics of how their nervous systems function will enable societies to better manage their health (e.g., helping insect pollinators) or combat their destruction (e.g., preventing locust plagues). invertebrate neurobiology is a course that will explore the underlying neural mechanisms that enable animals to solve or respond to particular problems encountered in their natural environments. many of the invertebrate animals presented will not only exhibit interesting behaviors, but will reveal important and often conserved principles of neuroscience applicable to a host of animals, including us humans. this course is designed to be integrative — including disciplines intersecting with animal behavior, entomology, evolution, ecology, neuroscience, psychology, and bioengineering. a major goal of this course is to widen one’s view of the importance of invertebrate animals in the field of neuroscience and gain an appreciation of the translational impact that this knowledge can have and will continue to have on our society and daily lives. students will also be introduced to important concepts in neurobiology and learn how small neural networks operate.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"ENT 5900","subject":"ENT","id":"5900","title":"Basic Entomology","info":"for graduate students who need to make up certain deficiencies in their
