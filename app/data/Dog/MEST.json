In contrast to misconceptions of a homogenous white European past, the reality of medieval Europe was diverse and complex, and its boundaries - geographical, cultural, bodily, and otherwise - were in flux, as reflected in its visual and material culture.",

But we will also range more broadly, exploring witchcraft in the early Atlantic world by paying special attention to the roles played by magic and possession. A fundamental aspect of this course, moreover, is its distinction as a literary one. This is not a class about how witchcraft, possession, and magic \"change over time\" but a class about their representations. From the beginning, we will be deeply attentive to the fact that each and every \"evidence\" of witchcraft, possession, or magic is an act of representation in the first place. \n\nAs literary historians, we will move from Europe to the Americas, looking at how invocations and accusations of witchcraft traveled between the 16th and late-18th centuries. More importantly, as literary critics we will trace and examine depictions of witchcraft and the idea of the witch across four interrelated socio-historical contexts: the Protestant Reformation in 16th-century Europe; slave medicine and obeah in the Caribbean; possession and the \"invisible world\" in Puritan Massachusetts; and revivalism in 18th-century New England. \n\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to: interpret literary texts and understand the literary aspects of historical documents; place literature in relation to its historical and cultural contexts; locate and evaluate relevant scholarship and cultural commentary; and formulate and communicate a focused and stylistically appropriate that supports its claims with textual evidence, especially through close and critical reading.",

    "info": "Medieval writers and readers were fascinated by stories about knights and about pilgrims.  In this course, we study some of the best-known and most compelling narratives and poems from the Middle Ages.  Although written hundreds of years ago, these literary works speak to us of the human desire to strive for meaning and excellence, to work toward shared ideas of community, and to explore worlds beyond the sometimes narrow confines of home.\n\nKnights and pilgrims appear as central figures in a wide range of literary works.  Some of the texts are humorous, like Chaucer's Canterbury Tales in which pilgrims, from social classes ranging from knights to tradespeople, travel together and tell stories.  Some are exciting and emotional, like Malory's retelling of stories about King Arthur and his knights.  Others provide us with explorations of longing for change:  in these works people search for new kinds of social and spiritual life such as Margery Kempe's autobiographical account of her experiences as a pilgrim to Rome and the Holy Land.  Still others, such as Langland's Piers Plowman, which incorporates pilgrimage and chivalric quest, critique and explode static ideas about social problems such as poverty and hunger.  Some draw our attention to the dangers and turmoil involved in love and relationships, such as Marie de France's courtly, aristocratic lays:  Marie's knights and ladies take up the search for love and meaning.  Some, finally, invite us to imagine ourselves in mysterious otherworlds, such as Mandeville's Travels and Sir Orfeo, both of which focus on travel and self knowledge.  These exciting and challenging works continue to speak to us about the quest to pursue ideals and to change the world and ourselves",

We'll delve into Douglas's theory in light of ancient examples with a special focus on ancient Israelite texts (the Tanakh or Old Testament) as well as ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern building inscriptions, specialist manuals, and rituals. Through this evidence, we'll gain profound insight into the ancient notions of \"sacred/clean\" (purity) and the \"unclean/profane\" (pollution).",

Wherever there was trade, wherever there was movement on the seas, there was piracy. Recent scholarship on the Mediterranean has focused on connectivities, micro-environments, the uniqueness of islands, and various climatic spheres in a geographic tradition that follows the path-breaking work of Fernand Braudel. This course will consider the urban and rural dimensions of the Mediterranean region as they relate to the history of merchants and pirates. Finally, the political and military aspects of Mediterranean history will be examined. There was a continuum from piracy to privateering to war. Students should gain a deeper understanding of a region that continues to fascinate us today.",

This course is an introduction to the rich language and literature of Anglo-Saxon England (ca. 500-1100).  \"Old English,\" or as it is sometimes known, \"Anglo-Saxon,\" is the earliest form of the English language; therefore, the primary course goal will be to acquire the ability to read Old English texts in the original.  No previous experience with Old English or any other language is necessary or expected; undergraduates and graduate students from all departments are welcome.  For graduate students in English, Old English I may count for the rhetoric/language/literacy distribution area. This course also fulfills the literary theory/linguistic requirement for the undergraduate English major. A knowledge of Old English will allow you to touch the most ancient literary sensibilities in the English tradition; these sensibilities are familiar and strange at the same time, as we sense our deep cultural connection to these texts across the centuries, yet also find that the past is a strange place indeed.  The power of Old English literature has profoundly influenced authors such as Tennyson, Pound, Graves, Wilbur, Hopkins, Gunn, Auden, Seamus Heaney, C.S. Lewis, and of course, J.R.R. Tolkien.",

We will read and translate the poem in the original Old English; thus ENGL 4612 (or a similar course resulting in a basic reading knowledge of Old English) is a prerequisite. \"Beowulf\" has been the object of intensive scholarly study; we will delve into the debates over the poem's date, genesis, manuscript and historical context and critical interpretation.

We consider diverse media from ancient to modern periods, including painting, sculpture, photography, architecture, inscriptions, and literature. \n\nThis course explores the concept of embodiment in the diverse artistic traditions of South Asia. We will consider how ideas of representation of an individual have been understood and expressed differently across the history of South Asian art and religions. The course will consider the embodied representation of deities and semi-divine figures along with those of “real” people; we will consider, given the ontologies of such representations in their religious and cultural contexts. Representation of an individual – a portrait – is a foundational subject in the canon of art history. What does the very idea of a portrait mean so far outside the canon of (Western) art history? As we survey the diverse traditions and media of images of the body, we will be attentive to questions such as, does media make meaning for these types of images? Can a ‘portrait’ be textual? Is verisimilitude essential to the depiction of a person? In what ways are practices of depiction informed by other modes of image-making, such as images of religious devotion, and traditions of representation encountered through trade or gift? We will consider diverse media from Ancient India to the modern period, including painting, stone and metal sculpture, photography, architecture, inscriptions, and even a Sanskrit play. ",
