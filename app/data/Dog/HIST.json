civilizations from their beginnings to the present. with over three millennia as its subject, the course must of necessity be a general survey. together we will explore the mythic structures, significant documents, historical experiences, narratives, practices, beliefs, and worldviews of the jewish people. the course begins by examining the roots of judaism in the hebrew bible and the history of ancient israel but quickly focuses on the creative forces that developed within judaism as a national narrative confronted the forces of history, especially in the forms of the persian, greek, and roman empires. rabbinic judaism becomes the most dominant creative force and will receive our greatest attention, both in its formative years and as it encounters the rise of christianity and islam. after studying the jewish experience in the medieval world, we will turn to judaism’s encounter with the enlightenment and modernity. the historical survey concludes by attending to the transformations within judaism and jewish life of the last 150 years, including a confrontation with the experience of the holocaust. woven throughout this historical survey will be repeated engagements with core questions: “who is a jew?” “what do jews believe?” “what do jews do?” “what do we mean by ‘religion’?”   “how do jews read texts within their tradition?” and perhaps most importantly, “how many answers are there to a jewish question?” students in this course can expect to come away with some knowledge of the bible in judaism, rabbinic literature and law, jewish mysticism and philosophy, jewish nationalism and zionism, jewish culture, ritual, and worship in the synagogue, the home, and the community, and jewish celebrations of life cycle events and the festivals.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"HIST 1809","subject":"HIST","id":"1809","title":"The Presidency in the US","info":"this course explores the emergence, meaning, and evolution of the

social movements from the civil rights and black, brown, yellow and red power movements to the countercultural, student/campus, anti-war, feminist, and environmental movements. it was also marked by the rise of a series of new right movements from the rise of the barry goldwater to the election of richard nixon and the transformation of both the democratic and republican parties. major immigration reform, transformations in the nation's educational and health care systems, along side new patterns of consumption and new forms of media were also products of the sixties. from the cold war to the vietnam war, from anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism to third world revolutions, americans transformed the world and the us was transformed by the world in the sixties.\n\nfifty years removed from the sixties, the idea of the sixties remains alive in the american imagination. it remains alive and in tension with the new movements, like black lives matters, and in political thought, as, for example, in donald trump's repeated invocation of the \\\"silent majority.\\\" \n\nstudents will explore a wealth of primary sources and be introduced to the dynamic historiography of the

still matter today? exploring changing meanings of manhood and the complicated constructions of masculinity from the colonial era to the present, this course argues that understanding \\\"men,\\\" \\\"manhood,\\\" and \\\"masculinity\\\" is central to understanding united states history. at this nation's founding, family manhood was central to maintaining social order in the colonies and citizenship rights were the sole possession of those who could claim to be free, white, and male. up through the 20th century, manhood has frequently been associated with specific sets of political, economic, social, and familial rights and responsibilities. at the same time, the denial of rights to large portions of the nation can be traced to their purported lack of manhood. students in this

Death: Plague in History","info":"in 1348, the disease that would be called the black death (the second pandemic) swept west from central asia to europe, where it quickly annihilated up to 60% of europe's population in the years 1347-1352. this was neither the first nor the last occurrence of this dreaded disease in world history. the justinianic plague of the 6th century (the first pandemic) was devastating as well. plague recurred again and again, with the third pandemic coming at the end of the 19th century. the effects of the plague on the social fabric of the societies with which it came into contact were considerable, but so were the psychic effects, and the religious, intellectual, medical, and artistic worlds felt compelled to attempt to understand what the plague was, as well as its grander philosophical and moral implications. this course will consider the modern scientific advances in understanding the disease and the medieval sources that document its devastation.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"HIST 1916","subject":"HIST","id":"1916","title":"Herders and History","info":"this seminar explores herding societies found throughout the

environmental conditions, the we will explore how these conditions determined the level of their interaction/relationship with domesticated and non-domesticated animals. we will also examine the

Anti-Racism & America","info":"is racism integral, or antithetical, to the american dream? to what degree has its promise of freedom and prosperity rested on the exclusion of indigenous, black and other people of color from those opportunities? have white americans achieved its promise of freedom and prosperity at the expense of others? or, has the dream been perverted by the exclusion of black, indigenous, and people of color to what martin luther king described as \\\"a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity\\\"? moreover, to what extent have americans resisted their exclusion or the exclusion of others from the promise of the dream? given that in the contemporary moment, inequality in the us has surpassed that of the great depression, what do these fractures and contestations in the american dream mean for a larger society experiencing rampant precarity writ large? \n\nthis pair of seminars (anth 1917 and hist 1917) explores these questions in dialogue, occasionally meeting together and with a larger group of seminars connected to the college of liberal arts's living and learning in the land of 10,000 perspectives? civic readiness initiative. we believe that this cross-fertilization is critical because the fault-lines of inequality have precisely cohered to these structural formations and categories of analysis, i.e. race and racism. moreover, an interdisciplinary approach (through anthropology and history) is crucial for examining the contested nature, historical contexts, and contemporary investments of the american dream.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"HIST 1919W","subject":"HIST","id":"1919W","title":"Autobiography through History","info":"what do french enlightenment philosopher jean-jacques

motives for telling them. historians tend to be skeptical of autobiographies because their authors are bound to be less than completely truthful in writing them. still, they offer us a take on the past that is unique … and not just from the perspective of the famous or powerful. we can also find life stories written or told orally by ordinary people as well. this seminar will explore stories that people tell about their lives in different eras and cultures. we will address questions about how to read life stories for the historical truths they reveal (and conceal).","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"HIST 1921","subject":"HIST","id":"1921","title":"Brexit and Decolonization","info":"among recent political moments, brexit stands as one of the most confusing. from the shock vote in 2016 through the fall of two prime ministers and two general elections, brexit has proven to be a paralyzing development in britain, and a car-crash spectacle for the rest of the world.\n\nin this seminar, we will work to understand brexit not as a single event but as a part of the century-long process of decolonization. in 1900 britain was the most powerful and important global force, claiming a quarter of the world’s land and population. by 2016, britain was again reduced to a small island nation, more defined by its relationship to the us and europe than its own power and importance. we will read through the history and theory of decolonization. this will lead to an understanding of how the breakup of the empire came to define contemporary britain, and how brexit is the culmination of that process. we will learn how to use empire, race, and nation as ways to critically read current events.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"HIST

visit many of the sites they have examined in class. more broadly, though, the course will raise fundamental questions concerning social ideals, themes, and issues that are important in any cultural context: how does one create and sustain a thriving and equitable society? how does injustice manifest itself, and what are its remedies? what is the impact of war and violence? what specific challenges do migrants, refugees, and other outsider groups face? the course will run chronologically from the medieval past and early days of legend to the rise and ultimate collapse of communism in

this seminar gives a basic understanding of how “hunger” came to be understood and dealt with globally after wwii, how cold-war geopolitics affected food shortage and surplus, how the global food system has gotten us where we are, and what new options are being pursued now. in all these stages, the us has played a central role in shaping the politics of food and hunger. the first part of the course exposes you to important concepts and issues related to politics around world hunger, american food aid, and multi-national agribusiness; students learn how to read texts closely and how to connect american food aid to global politics. the second part of the course helps you acquire research and communication skills; students learn how to conduct independent research and how to use a digital humanities tool called storymap. the course is composed of lectures, discussions, documentary film viewing, and research/storymap creation.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"HIST 1924","subject":"HIST","id":"1924","title":"Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit","info":"in 1776, when thomas jefferson announced the goal of the new united states of america to be securing for all people the rights of \\\"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,\\\" he was implicitly echoing the ideals of the new and modernizing culture that historians have come to call \\\"the enlightenment.\\\" the eighteenth-century enlightenment gave birth to a new sense of the human being and his and her place in the new naturalized understanding of society and government that was also articulated at this time. jefferson's stress upon happiness as a human right also pointed to the new importance placed upon material pleasure and the permission to go after it (read: liberty even as it leads to libertinism and licentiousness). a time of profound philosophizing and scientific breakthroughs, the enlightenment was just as often found in its wit, humor, and snarky take downs of traditional authorities and the pompous pretensions of the establishment. jefferson illustrates well the serious side of enlightenment, but just as emblematic was the freethinking ben franklin and the john oliver style news-a-comedy circulated by the self-styled french philosophers denis diderot and voltaire. this course will survey the highlights of enlightenment conceived as that historical moment when our own free and pleasure-driven modernity was born, along with the science and philosophy that grounds it. readings will focus on original enlightenment texts, including philosophy and science, but also novels, bawdy dialogues, satirical poems and essays, paintings and engravings, plays, the autobiography of an emancipated slave, and an opera. class sessions will be devoted to discussing the texts in light of their contemporary and historical resonances, and student work will focus on writing reflective and interpretive essays and commentaries asking and answering the questions \\\"what is

the rules of the societies in which they lived. in the world of #metoo and with our first female vice president, it is particularly important to study how women have challenged the status quo and how history can inform our future efforts. the course will provide an introduction to feminist theory, and throughout the semester we will grapple with the relationship of feminist studies to issues of race, ethnicity, and trans-identity. through the history of compliance and non-compliance, students will learn to interrogate the idea of history as progress, and how ideas about gender have been historically constructed.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"HIST 1926","subject":"HIST","id":"1926","title":"A History of Greater Minnesota","info":"this freshman seminar will develop the topic of “inequality, polarization, and social change” as suggested by the cla.  the course will cover the history of rural minnesota from the 17th to the 21st century, and it will focus on how identities of ethnicity, race, and class were produced historically and then leveraged by social movements.  while many think of the state in terms of “minnesota nice”, fewer are used to considering the history of rural minnesota as radical - questioning and challenging the fundamental structures of society.  there are a number of topics this course will cover--from the rise and fall of the farm-labor movement to the emigration of hmong people to the state.  as bookends, the course will begin with the many changes in the indigenous societies of minnesota in the 18th and 19th century, and it will end with the events of 2020.  this seminar will utilize collections at the minnesota historical society, the mill city museum, the american swedish institute, the hmong museum as well as collections held by the university of minnesota library system. the umn rate system could be easily incorporated into the course assignments as the freshmen learn how to “do college” as so many of them describe it. the course will focus on rural minnesota specifically to ask how the region participated in and then abandoned various social movements from radical republicanism to the farm-labor movement to present day trumpism. in this process, the class will ask what a more just minnesota could have and should look like.  we will also investigate the role of respectful disagreement in public discourse

european history is a thousand years long and contains all the complexity, the mess, and the human capacity for good and evil as any other place and time. and yet this period of history remains haunted by the ghosts of the renaissance, the age of imperialism, and even today’s tv shows like vikings or game of thrones. how do historians craft new and more persuasive narratives about the past? how do we shape what people remember? in this class, students will work on how we tell stories about big periods in the past, focusing first on the battle against the so-called dark ages, but then looking at the ways ongoing battles about how to tell our stories from antiquity to now play out in the classroom, our political arenas, in our entertainments, and beyond.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"HIST 1929","subject":"HIST","id":"1929","title":"History Through Board Games","info":"when pandemic lockdowns and restrictions forced people to stay at home beginning in 2020, sales of board games soared in the united states; they are still having something of a “moment” in our zeitgeist. this course uses board games—from the medieval game of chess, beloved by shahs and emperors alike, to the “family game night” classics like monopoly, to complex and intricate strategy games of the 21st century—as tools to view and study the past and to reflect on the present. the first third of the course engages with global and social history with a grounding in historical methods and theory. the second third plunges students directly into practical gameplaying and analysis, where they will learn the salient aspects of modern board gaming. they will also connect with a local board game company, one of the nation’s leading game makers, to understand the burgeoning business and make connections with industry innovators. in the final part of class, students will culminate their learning by designing, testing, producing, a game of their own, based on a careful reading and understanding of primary and secondary source material.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"HIST 1930","subject":"HIST","id":"1930","title":"Democracy under Threat","info":"is democracy under threat? the upsurge of populist authoritarianism and racial nationalism around the globe in conjunction with recent assaults on traditional political institutions in the united states have raised concerns about the fate and future of democracy. political scientists largely agree that the united states has become more democratic over the past two centuries, but results from the authoritarian warning survey, a democratic-monitoring project, highlight the erosion of democratic principles and institutions in the past few years. concerns about the meaning, nature, promise, stability or instability of democracy are, however, not new. in order to better understand contemporary threats to democracy this course explores how the meanings and understandings of democracy changed over the last few centuries by examining the complicated relationship between democracy, populism and racial nationalism. is democracy a product of populism or imperiled by populism? what is the contemporary and historical relationship between democracy and racial nationalism? this seminar delves deeply into these questions by exploring a series of moments when the meanings and promise of democracy were contested. it begins with fundamental questions about the racial and gendered origins of american democracy. what is the relationship between the democratic state, the slave state and the settler colonial state? how did racial nationalism constitute and imperil american democracy from its origins? populists, that is members of mass movements that claim to speak for \\\"the people,\\\" have struggled to both extend and redefine the limits of democracy. in these efforts, \\\"citizens\\\" have frequently been pitted against non-citizens making questions of immigration, naturalization, and detention central to contestations over democracy and its perceived threats. moreover, in the united states, the relationship between detention and democracy can not be fully explored without paying significant attention to the rise of mass incarceration over the past half century. to what extent is the democratic state today threatened or maintained through the carceral state? \n\nstudent will engage with these issues through interdisciplinary lectures, course readings and discussions, and conversations with scholars, activists and organizations fostering democratic values and racial justice.\n\nthis course comes out of the democracy under threat interdisciplinary collaborative workshop. students will be invited to all democracy under threat events during the 2019-2020 academic year, including a spring 2020 conference, \\\"democracy under threat in times of populism and racial nationalism\\\" that will be held at the university of minnesota in partnership with howard university, morehouse college, and spelman college.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"HIST 1931","subject":"HIST","id":"1931","title":"Monkey King: The Novel","info":"in this course, we will look at both the sources for and the afterlives of the great chinese novel, xiyouji, sometimes translated into english as journey to the west, and sometimes as monkey or the monkey king. the novel traces the journey of four pilgrims--a hapless monk, a mischievious monkey, a gluttonous pig, and a sand spirt--from china to india to gain buddhist scriptures. they have many humorous adventures. (there is nothing quite like humor to demonstrate the impermanence of things.) the story of the monkey king has been beloved by chinese readers, theater goers, movie patrons, and television audiences for centuries.  we will begin by reading a modern abridgement of the novel. we will look at questions such as: what is the nature of the humor in the novel? why has the monkey king been such a beloved figure in chinese popular culture? what can we learn about chinese society from this novel and its adaptations? all reading will be in english; no prior knowledge of chinese culture is assumed.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"HIST 1932","subject":"HIST","id":"1932","title":"Memory & Monuments in the US","info":"the murder of george floyd sparked intense activism in solidarity with the black lives matter movement around monuments to white supremacy and colonialism. protesters targeted statues glorifying confederate generals, the lost cause, and racist oppression in dozens of communities. protesters in richmond and st. paul toppled statues of christopher columbus, and several other cities, including columbus, ohio, removed their statues preemptively. these other anti-racism protests mark dramatic struggles over historical memory that spiked in the wake of the rally in charlottesville in 2017.\n\nhow do people arrive at their understandings of what happened in the past?  this seminar focuses on how historical interpretations are negotiated through commemorations, monuments, museums, reenactment, film, and other access points to history.  foregrounding issues of race, class, ethnicity, and gender, we will explore debates surrounding the production of historical interpretation memory.  public contests over historical meaning in relation to colonialism, events such as the civil war, world war ii, and 9/11 and even over the naming of places such as battlefields highlight the contested nature of history as well as the powerful hold of historical interpretation.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"HIST 3000","subject":"HIST","id":"3000","title":"New Topics in History","info":"courses on new topics in history, historical topics

separations and divisions (made visible in the proliferation of physical walls and the hardening of borders) between rich and poor, between the privileged and the disenfranchised, between those whose

in the south of africa – have been forced into our vision once again. it was not the pandemic that created this violence. nor was it the first time people had been outraged by a lack of action to address it. in the years approaching 2020, calls, protests and demonstrations were increasingly demanding the culture of impunity in gender based violence be ended; sometime with violent outcomes against the protestors themselves. over those same years, nationwide protests have rocked south africa’s university campuses. the student movements known as #rhodesmustfall, #feesmustfall and #rureferencelist highlight the contrasts and disappointments of the recent past in south africa, confront the legacy of racism and misogyny in its institutions and knowledge systems, and resonate with

the ancient near east.  their population and territory were small, and they could not resist conquest by larger, more powerful states like assyria and rome.  yet their ancient history matters greatly today, out of proportion to its insignificance during the periods in which it transpired.  the historical experiences of the people of israel and judah were accorded religious meaning and literary articulation in the hebrew bible (the old testament), which became a foundational text for judaism, christianity, and islam.  \n\nessential features of western as well as islamic civilization are predicated on some element of israel’s ancient past, as mediated through the bible; therefore it behooves us to understand that past.  but the bible is a religious work, not a transcript of events, and the history of ancient israel is not derived merely from reading the biblical accounts of it.  archaeological excavations have revealed the physical remains of the cultures of israel and neighboring lands, as well as bringing to light inscriptions, documents, and literary works produced by those cultures.  these sources, which complement and sometimes contradict the accounts conveyed in the bible, provide the basis for reconstructing a comprehensive history of ancient israel.\n\nthis course covers the history of israel and judah from the late bronze age (c. 1550-1200 bce), by the end of which israel had emerged as a distinct ethnic entity, to the period of roman rule (63 bce-330 ce), which saw the final extinction of ancient israel, represented by the kingdom of judea, as a political entity.  knowledge of this history is based on archaeological, epigraphic, and literary sources, including the hebrew bible.\n\nn.b.: students should be aware that the study of history, like all the human and natural sciences, is predicated on inquiry, not a priori judgments.  accordingly, the bible is not privileged as an intrinsically true or authoritative record.  no text is presumed inerrant, and all sources are subject to scrutiny, in the context of scholarly discourse.  biblical texts are treated just like all other texts, as the products of human beings embedded in a historical context, and as the subject of analysis and interpretation.  persons of all faiths and of no faith are equally welcome to participate in such scholarly discourse.  however, students who feel that their own religious beliefs require an understanding of the bible that is antithetical to the foregoing statements are cautioned that they may find themselves uncomfortable with this course.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"HIST 3503","subject":"HIST","id":"3503","title":"Ancient Iran","info":"development of ancient iranian culture under achaemenians and sassanians. impact

medieval world, we will turn to judaism’s encounter with the enlightenment and modernity. the historical survey concludes by attending to the transformations within judaism and jewish life of the last 150 years, including a confrontation with the experience of the holocaust. woven throughout this historical survey will be repeated engagements with core questions: “who is a jew?” “what do jews believe?” “what do jews do?” “what do we mean by ‘religion’?”   “how do jews read texts within their tradition?” and perhaps most importantly, “how many answers are there to a jewish question?” students in this course can expect to come away with some knowledge of the bible in judaism, rabbinic literature and law, jewish mysticism and philosophy, jewish nationalism and zionism, jewish culture, ritual, and worship in the synagogue, the home, and the community, and jewish celebrations of life cycle events and the festivals.","prereqInfo":null,"prereq":[]},{"code":"HIST

central and eastern european migration to the united states (u.s.) from the late 19th century to the present. moving chronologically and from the global to the local, this class will first examine the complex and intertwined reasons that prompted people to settle (either temporally or permanently) in the u.s. in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. we will explore the communalities and differences between the poles, ukrainians, germans, czechs, slovaks, jews, hungarians, slovenes, croats, and serbs who made up this initial wave of migration, and assess how these migrants shaped the urban and social fabric both in the united states, and in st. paul and minneapolis. second, the class will examine how these communities evolved over the course in the 20th century by a) exploring topics such as ethnic identity maintenance, inter-generational relations, return migration, xenophobia and antisemitism, the relationship between migrants and the host society, and institutions (churches and synagogues, fraternal organizations, learned societies, archives, museums and libraries, etc.) established by migrants in the u.s., and b) assessing the impacts of later migration waves from europe to the u.s., caused by the holocaust and the second world war, the 1956 hungarian uprising, the 1968 prague spring, soviet emigration policies, the fall of the berlin wall, and the civil wars in yugoslavia. \n\nkeeping in mind the pressing ethical questions that subtend migration (both historical and contemporary), this class will also ask what it means to be a descendant of central and eastern european migrants in present-day minnesota—not just of those who arrived over a century ago, but also more recent migrants, e.g., russians, or muslims from bosnia-hercegovina. to this end, we will enrich our classroom by extending it into the metro area with visits to relevant sites and meetings with representatives of some of these communities in order to understand their current

north america, europe, and africa had divergent ideas about the divine and its presence on earth, about life and life after death, about religious rituals and relations of authority.  their struggles with one another were partly struggles over religiously inflected ways of being in the world.  the course explores how religion shaped people’s responses to european colonization, the growing
