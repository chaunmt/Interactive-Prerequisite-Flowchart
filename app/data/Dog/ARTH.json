    "info": "one rather old and rigid concept in the history of art and aesthetics is that artistic media, each with its distinct qualities, are most successful when they remain separate. the best painting, according to this view, is one that explores its own properties of flatness, abstraction, and color. what became known in the first half of the 20th century as the philosophy of “medium specific purity” was radically challenged in the 1960s when the differences between painting and sculpture were intentionally blurred and when new media (performance, body art, happenings, video art, installations and digital art) were introduced. this course seeks to understand how alternative media were developed not through the invention of new technologies nor in isolation, but through revolutionary modes of thinking about time and space, human and non-human life, machines, archives, cyborgs, and interactivity (some of which date back to the 18th and 19th centuries). through assigned readings and discussions as well as structured essay assignments, the class provides students with extensive practice in the critical analysis of theoretical texts and ample experience synthesizing diverse intellectual ideas and arguments in written form. more broadly, through a creative “timeline” assignment, the course seeks to teach students to think inventively about new media and their histories, to learn strategies for looking at, evaluating, and thinking about works of new media art. it also provides instruction in research techniques and resources in contemporary art, as well as on writing in art history.",

    "info": "since the 19th century, artists, critics, and historians have deployed philosophical and theoretical ideas to think self-reflexively about the meaning of art. what counts as a work of art and who qualifies as an artist? what is the role of the viewer and how should works of art be interpreted? are they passive reflections of their historical milieu or do they play an active role in forming cultural values? in the 1920s, the surrealists were reading karl marx and sigmund freud to answer these questions. artists of the harlem renaissance studied the sociological essays of w.e.b. dubois and zora neale hurston. conceptualist artists in the 1960s read books on semiotics; performance artists studied phenomenology reading the work of maurice merleau-ponty. feminist artists in the 1970s read up on psychoanalysis and feminist philosophy. following in their footsteps, this is primarily a readings course designed to familiarize students with important theoretical ideas applied to the visual arts of the 20th century. the course focuses on significant trends in that century’s art theory, historical methodology, and criticism. it examines key philosophical ideas of modernism and postmodernism including formalism, semiotics, poststructuralism, feminism, marxism, psychoanalysis, deconstruction, critical race and queer theory. because the course is organized chronologically as well as thematically and follows the lives and writings of key figures, it is also intended to help students trace intellectual histories as they develop over the century. in addition, it seeks to foster students’ critical reading skills, discipline-specific writing skills, and to help them consider the historical implications of art theory for the production and reception of works of art today.",

    "info": "this course examines the mobility and agency of objects and people in diplomatic practice. an emerging body of scholarship within renaissance and early modern studies explores the exchange and global circulation of objects and their role in cultural encounters. the possibilities offered by this 'material turn' highlight the potential of objects to enable cultural contact, conversion, and exchange across traditional political and cultural boundaries. at the same time, recent innovative and interdisciplinary approaches to exchange highlight cultural aspects of the diplomatic encounter. as a result, the roles of diplomats, interpreters, merchants as well as various types of objects and services continue to be interpreted in new ways. this course will introduce students to canonical texts associated with gift-exchange and reciprocity, and will explore their relevance to the disciplines of history and art history particularly with regard to imperial encounters and exchanges.",
