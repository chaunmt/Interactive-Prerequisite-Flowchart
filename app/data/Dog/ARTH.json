What unique insights does it provide into the past? And, finally, what good does art do? Organized around these three central questions, lectures, readings, and assignments will address several themes, central to understanding the history of Western art in a wider global context: (1) the forms, functions, and symbolism of images, objects, and spaces; (2) materials, techniques, and skills deployed by artists, architects, artisans, and laborers to make aesthetic objects; (3) the historical and cultural construction of visual experiences; and (4) customs, beliefs, and values associated with art production, collection, and exhibition in various cultures, including patronage, fame, trade, cross-cultural influence, authenticity, and reproduction.",

It will cover works from ancient cultures to those of contemporary Asian diasporas. Resisting the impossible task of covering everything, we will instead home in on specific objects in order to understand them in their broader cultural, religious, and social contexts. We will trace the ways in which common themes and problems appear in different art forms and in different places, and we will discover the ways in which seemingly disparate styles and objects may be productively understood in conversation with each other. We will work together to create an interpretive model that is synthetic, critical, and appreciative of the enormously diverse field that is Asian Art. Lectures will move from explanatory descriptions of objects and histories that are covered in the textbook to critical interpretations of the historiographies that shape the contemporary reception of Asian art.",

Is there a relationship between reading text and reading an image? Does reality exist prior to its representation, or is it constituted through representation?\n\nThis course will examine these questions comparatively in Western and South Asian aesthetic and philosophical traditions, from Plato's \"Republic\" to Bharata's \"Natyasastra.\" We will study diverse media, from painting to photography to narrative fiction, and consider how the medium of representation relates to different forms of copying, imitation, and the production of knowledge.

From its inception, the Chicano Movement attracted artists who created a new aesthetic and framework for producing art, but they did not merely illustrate the social and civil rights movement by creating posters and flyers. Artists theorized, negotiated, proposed, and initiated new ethics, aesthetics, and ways of thinking that supported self-determination, hope, social critique, solidarity, and justice. Increasingly since the 1980s, Chicanas and Chicanx artists renegotiated this social justice contract. Chicana/o/x art continues to inform Mexican American cultural production and the nation’s cultural heritage. Social intervention, empowerment, and institutional critique remain some of the most important innovations of American artists, Chicana/o/x artists among them.",

These images exert a powerful influence on us, making our world cohere and forming the basis of strong communal identities. At the same time, without knowledge of their histories and conventions, they can stand as barriers to a more complex sense of the ground we stand on. This course will examine broadly the landscapes of the “North Country,” the area roughly corresponding to present-day Minnesota that has for thousands of years been home to the Dakota and Ojibwe peoples and their ancestors, and more recently to peoples of European descent who in the seventeenth century began to refashion the landscape of the North Country in their own image. The aim of the class is to explore but also to unsettle our received habits of imagining the landscape, in the process opening up possibilities we may not have considered before.",

Arts controversies raise many difficult questions that this class examines: should artists be allowed to use taxpayer funds to create works of art critical of the government or that some find offensive? Should public sculptures commemorate Confederates, slave owners, or colonialists? How do we know when something is obscene? Is censorship ethical? Do artists have the right to control the fate of their work after it is sold? Who should decide what artists are chosen for public commissions, what artworks are selected for public buildings, or how works of art should be interpreted? Does public opinion make bad art? This course trains students in the history of arts controversies in the United States from the 19th century to the present and in the changing social conditions through which art has become a flashpoint for public debate. Assignments focus on discipline-specific research and writing techniques that build toward a group project in which students research, take up positions, and debate the merits of important case studies. The class is primarily designed for students to learn about the arts and arts policy today, i.e., the art world of which they are and will be citizens. They are asked to inspect the sources of dominant cultural beliefs and to gain a deeper understanding of and take responsibility for their own cultural, political, and artistic values.",

Such art has had a prominent place in art’s history, but do we really need art to save the environment? Studies repeatedly show that the arts are crucial to understanding and forestalling environmental disaster because, it turns out, human attitudes are shaped by the stories we tell, by our ability to imagine the unimaginable, to accept the inanimate as potentially coming to life, to picture things on a vast scale. In this course students learn the historical development of artistic movements from 1968, when the first exhibition of such art, called “Earthworks,” took place at the Dwan Gallery in New York, up to the present day. The course tracks the changing aesthetic, political, and climatic forces that influenced such art, from the anti-institutionalism and participatory approaches of the 1960s to the more activist artistic engagement with environmentalism today. The class takes up two primary concerns: understanding the historical and scientific conditions that have given rise to such art and learning the ways in which artists have sought to intervene in and affect a changing environment. Students put historical knowledge, environmental research, and visual analysis skills to work in a culminating group project creating art that responds to a contemporary environmental problem.",

It is a moment that sees dramatic changes in who artists are, how they are trained, what kind of art they make, and the audiences to whom they appeal. This course surveys U.S. and European art history from 1945 to the present so that students gain a thorough understanding of the social, political, and economic forces that contributed to the development of significant art movements including abstract expressionism, pop art, and minimalism, as well as key modes of artmaking including painting and sculpture, happenings, installations, video, earthworks, and participatory art. The course also trains students in philosophies of art and tracks the dramatic changes in aesthetics over the period. Primarily a lecture course, students’ historical knowledge is assessed through two in-class examinations in which they identify, compare, contrast, and think critically about works of art. In addition, students practice discipline-specific research skills by compiling an annotated bibliography and writing short papers that rigorously examine primary sources. \n\n",

Discussions, readings, and coursework include consideration of gallery and public space and audience experience. Curatorial trends will be explored via site visits to established and alternative exhibit spaces. Students are introduced to a wide variety of artists and how their work is contextualized by the exhibition format. Site visits to exhibition spaces and conversations with professional curators reinforce the course material. Through practice and application, students examine the evolving definitions and responsibilities of a curator, and a variety of issues related to the development of a coherent and relevant exhibition.

This course explores contemporary sub-Saharan African popular cinema, popular music, TV/radio series, bus slogans, community theatre, graphic narratives, fashion, sports, and other forms of popular communication as signifiers of larger social, political, and economic processes. It examines popular cultural forms as constantly evolving expressions of social, political, and personal identities in an ever globalized and interconnected world. As sites where the tensions, frictions, collisions and notably, the productive creativities of the local and the global are circulated, negotiated and contested African popular cultures provide insights into a unique and increasingly crucial facet of contemporary African artistic practice as critical intervention. Through our discussion of art and gender, we will examine the gendering of specific popular forms, their role in hegemonic formations, as well as their subversion in resistant practices and discourses.",

Designed for undergraduate art history majors but open to any students interested in the field, “What Art Historians Do” serves as an introduction to the history of the discipline as well as to its research, writing, and interpretative methods. The course is designed as a seminar in which students are trained in historical, philosophical, and practical knowledge.  They study the European origins of the academic discipline and its development and global expansion over time. They debate such questions as the purpose of art, the changing definition–across time, geographical regions, and cultures–of the artist, the limitations and implications  of history, and the place of museums in both preserving and destroying cultural heritage. And they learn and practice research techniques in material and digital archives and in primary and secondary sources, as well as different writing methods including museum didactics, scholarly papers, journalism, and social media. \n\nThis course is a new requirement for any student who declares their art history major in Fall 2023 or later.",

Techniques of woodcut, engraving and etching quickly became important media for innovation within the fine arts. At the same time, they became equally important as sources for devotional imagery, for disseminating copies of other artworks, for the expansion of knowledge through scientific illustration, and for the effective broadcasting of political and religious messages during centuries of extraordinary political and religious upheaval. In this course we will investigate the cultural history of printed images in Europe from the time of their emergence in the fifteenth century through the mid-eighteenth century. Through lectures and class discussion, you will develop a familiarity with the technical aspects of printmaking and apply that understanding to the historical interpretation of specific works. The course will not be an exhaustive survey of printmakers and printmaking styles during the early modern era but will instead approach the early modern print through the changing cultural circumstances of its production and reception. While we will consider the work of many lesser-known (and anonymous) artists, we will concentrate on the work of major printmakers such as Mantegna, Dürer, Goltzius, Rembrandt, Callot, Hogarth, and Piranesi.

    "info": "In 1863, Édouard Manet painted a scandalous nude titled Olympia, which was met with outrage by critics when it was exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1865. The painting has been the subject of extensive discussion ever since among critics, curators, and art historians who examine not only its modernist style and formal qualities, but also the class, racial, and sexual identities of the two figures it depicts. This course surveys the role gender and sexuality have played in the historical development of western art from Manet’s Olympia to the present, and the role that art has played in both reinforcing and challenging dominant theories of gender identity. It considers modernism and postmodernism not only as products of the rise of industrial and post-industrial capitalism, urbanization, colonialism, and globalization, etc., but also as tangled up with the establishment of gender and sexuality as powerful ideas that bring into being the very categories they name. Students gain knowledge not only about the historical development of art throughout this period, but also about diverse strategies for scholarly research that is informed by theories of gender and sexuality, and art historical models for reading bodies, gestures, texts, and works of art. They complete guided or independent research papers, prepare an in-class presentation on a work of art in a local museum, and complete a structured literature review through which they learn to read and critically evaluate art historical scholarship.

    "title": "Alternative Media",
    "info": "One rather old and rigid concept in the history of art and aesthetics is that artistic media, each with its distinct qualities, are most successful when they remain separate. The best painting, according to this view, is one that explores its own properties of flatness, abstraction, and color. What became known in the first half of the 20th century as the philosophy of “medium specific purity” was radically challenged in the 1960s when the differences between painting and sculpture were intentionally blurred and when new media (performance, body art, happenings, video art, installations and digital art) were introduced. This course seeks to understand how alternative media were developed not through the invention of new technologies nor in isolation, but through revolutionary modes of thinking about time and space, human and non-human life, machines, archives, cyborgs, and interactivity (some of which date back to the 18th and 19th centuries). Through assigned readings and discussions as well as structured essay assignments, the class provides students with extensive practice in the critical analysis of theoretical texts and ample experience synthesizing diverse intellectual ideas and arguments in written form. More broadly, through a creative “timeline” assignment, the course seeks to teach students to think inventively about new media and their histories, to learn strategies for looking at, evaluating, and thinking about works of new media art. It also provides instruction in research techniques and resources in contemporary art, as well as on writing in art history.",

    "title": "20th Century Theory/Criticism",
    "info": "Since the 19th century, artists, critics, and historians have deployed philosophical and theoretical ideas to think self-reflexively about the meaning of art. What counts as a work of art and who qualifies as an artist? What is the role of the viewer and how should works of art be interpreted? Are they passive reflections of their historical milieu or do they play an active role in forming cultural values? In the 1920s, the surrealists were reading Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud to answer these questions. Artists of the Harlem Renaissance studied the sociological essays of W.E.B. Dubois and Zora Neale Hurston. Conceptualist artists in the 1960s read books on semiotics; performance artists studied phenomenology reading the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty. Feminist artists in the 1970s read up on psychoanalysis and feminist philosophy. Following in their footsteps, this is primarily a readings course designed to familiarize students with important theoretical ideas applied to the visual arts of the 20th century. The course focuses on significant trends in that century’s art theory, historical methodology, and criticism. It examines key philosophical ideas of modernism and postmodernism including formalism, semiotics, poststructuralism, feminism, Marxism, psychoanalysis, deconstruction, critical race and queer theory. Because the course is organized chronologically as well as thematically and follows the lives and writings of key figures, it is also intended to help students trace intellectual histories as they develop over the century. In addition, it seeks to foster students’ critical reading skills, discipline-specific writing skills, and to help them consider the historical implications of art theory for the production and reception of works of art today.

The course begins with a review of important movements, significant artists, and influential theories and issues. It then takes up and studies specific themes through the reading and analysis of theoretical texts. Students are asked to read, participate in class discussions, complete guided or independent research papers, prepare an in-class presentation on one of the course themes, and complete a book review for a textbook on contemporary art history.

This class will examine the social and cultural history of the United States from 1865-1910, by following the visual record of paintings, sculpture, photographs, architecture, and landscape and furniture design. We will look closely at works by artists including Winslow Homer, Abbott Thayer, Cecilia Beaux, Henry Ossawa Tanner, Jacob Riis, Gertrude Käsebier, Thomas Nast, Bernhard Gillam, Frederick Law Olmsted, McKim, Mead & White, and Candace Wheeler. We will consider the role of creatively made images and objects as both a tool of the elite and the weapon of the critic. And we will actively investigate the kinds of questions art historians ask about this era, so as to ask new questions and produce new scholarship that might productively address the concerns of our own. Open to interested students from all majors, this course culminates in an independent research project suitable for development as a senior capstone project.\n",

Throughout the semester, you will learn the skills of visual analysis, archive- and object-based research, and writing for public audiences. The final project involves conducting original research on an artist or artwork of your choosing, and communicating your findings in a final project that will take the form of your choice (e.g., podcast, online exhibition, visual artwork, traditional academic paper, etc.).",

We will survey the diversity of representations and concepts of space, such as painted banners, murals, poetry, architecture, and urban form. We will examine works of art from the major religious traditions of South Asia: Hinduism, Islam, Jainism, and Buddhism. Course readings will interweave theoretical or methodological texts with historical examples.

Representation of an individual—a portrait—is a foundational subject in the canon of art history. What does the very idea of a portrait mean so far outside the canon of (Western) art history? As we survey the diverse traditions and media of images of the body, we will be attentive to questions such as, Does media make meaning for these types of images? Can a 'portrait' be textual? Is verisimilitude essential to the depiction of a person? In what ways are practices of depiction informed by other modes of image-making, such as images of religious devotion, and traditions of representation encountered through trade or gift? We will consider diverse media from Ancient India to the modern period, including painting, stone and metal sculpture, photography, architecture, inscriptions, and even a Sanskrit play.",

We will study the developments leading to magnificent structures, such as the Taj Mahal, asking why such a structure could be built when Islam discourages monumental mausolea.  In what ways the schools of painting that are the products of both Muslim and Hindu rulers different and similar? The course will also consider artistic production in the important Hindu kingdoms that ruled India concurrently with the great Muslim powers. In the 18th century, colonialist forces enter the subcontinent, resulting in significant innovative artistic trends. Among questions we will ask is how did these kingdoms influence one another? Throughout we will probe which forms and ideas seem to be inherently Indian, asking which ones transcend dynastic, geographic and religious differences and which forms and ideas are consistent throughout these periods of political and ideological change.

    "info": "This course examines the mobility and agency of objects and people in diplomatic practice. An emerging body of scholarship within Renaissance and early modern studies explores the exchange and global circulation of objects and their role in cultural encounters. The possibilities offered by this 'material turn' highlight the potential of objects to enable cultural contact, conversion, and exchange across traditional political and cultural boundaries. At the same time, recent innovative and interdisciplinary approaches to exchange highlight cultural aspects of the diplomatic encounter. As a result, the roles of diplomats, interpreters, merchants as well as various types of objects and services continue to be interpreted in new ways. This course will introduce students to canonical texts associated with gift-exchange and reciprocity, and will explore their relevance to the disciplines of history and art history particularly with regard to imperial encounters and exchanges.
