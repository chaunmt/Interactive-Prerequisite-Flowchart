    "info": "our planet earth is dominated (>70%) by water. the hydrosphere contains about 1.36 billion cubic kilometers of water mostly in the form of a liquid (water) that occupies topographic depressions on the earth. the second most common form of the water molecule on our planet is ice. if all our planet's ice melted, sea-level would rise by about 70 meters.\n\nwater is also essential for life. most animals and plants contain more than 60% water by volume. without water, life would probably never have developed on our planet. water contains nutrients that are essential for life. nutrients are extracted from rocks and sediments. \n\nat present, human activity is dumping harmful pollutants (poisons) in surface and ground water. poisons distribute between water and sediments, depending on the properties of the toxin, soil characteristics and water chemistry. therefore, poisons present in water may contaminate both the aquatic and the soil dwellers, and plants, thus contaminating the food chain for humans as well as animals. the overall aim of this course is to discuss (i) effects of water pollution on aquatic and terrestrial organism including humans, (ii) water quality issues and (iii) water safety. after completing this course, participants will be able to:\n\n-understand physicochemical and solubility properties of water.\n-compare and contrast toxins? behavior in water, soil, air and organisms.\n-understand the concept of clean and polluted water.\n-understand modes of action of toxic chemicals, types of effects from the molecular to the ecosystem level, and detoxification processes.\n-understand food-chain contamination and ensuing toxicity.",

    "info": "garbage, in a broad sense, can be defined as anything (solids, liquid or gas) carelessly discarded because it is perceived to be worthless in our homes, businesses, institutions and factories. when humans were hunters and gatherers, they consumed what was needed, discarded what could not be used and moved on. being part of nature, the discarded items degraded into reusable nutrients. the humans' interaction with the environment was well balanced and humans' footprints on the earth were very minute, if at all. however, as the industrial revolution led to the development of large industries, humans began to invent things that were not part of nature, thus the natural balance began to misbalance. this results in accumulation of garbage into the environment, resulting in pollution of the atmosphere, land and water sources. \n\nrecently, economic globalization has further increased the magnitude of environmental pollution and ensuing deterioration of public health. if the current trend is not reversed, planet earth may eventually become uninhabitable. therefore, the students registering in this course will:\n(1) learn the processes that facilitate generation and accumulation of garbage, \n(2) understand the mechanisms responsible for pollution of the earth?s environment,\n(3) characterize the health effects of the polluted environment,\n(4) strategize remediation steps that may halt or repair the damage and \n(5) interpret data in writing and verbally.",
