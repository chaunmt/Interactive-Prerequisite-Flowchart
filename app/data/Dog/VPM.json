The hydrosphere contains about 1.36 billion cubic kilometers of water mostly in the form of a liquid (water) that occupies topographic depressions on the Earth. The second most common form of the water molecule on our planet is ice. If all our planet's ice melted, sea-level would rise by about 70 meters.\n\nWater is also essential for life. Most animals and plants contain more than 60% water by volume. Without water, life would probably never have developed on our planet. Water contains nutrients that are essential for life. Nutrients are extracted from rocks and sediments. \n\nAt present, human activity is dumping harmful pollutants (poisons) in surface and ground water. Poisons distribute between water and sediments, depending on the properties of the toxin, soil characteristics and water chemistry. Therefore, poisons present in water may contaminate both the aquatic and the soil dwellers, and plants, thus contaminating the food chain for humans as well as animals. The overall aim of this course is to discuss (i) effects of water pollution on aquatic and terrestrial organism including humans, (ii) water quality issues and (iii) water safety. After completing this course, participants will be able to:\n\n-Understand physicochemical and solubility properties of water.\n-Compare and contrast toxins? behavior in water, soil, air and organisms.\n-Understand the concept of clean and polluted water.\n-Understand modes of action of toxic chemicals, types of effects from the molecular to the ecosystem level, and detoxification processes.\n-Understand food-chain contamination and ensuing toxicity.","prereq":[]},{"code":"VPM 1902","subject":"VPM","id":"1902","title":"Garbage, Government, the Globe","info":"Garbage, in a broad sense, can be defined as anything (solids, liquid or gas) carelessly discarded because it is perceived to be worthless in our homes, businesses, institutions and factories. When humans were hunters and gatherers, they consumed what was needed, discarded what could not be used and moved on. Being part of nature, the discarded items degraded into reusable nutrients. The humans' interaction with the environment was well balanced and humans' footprints on the Earth were very minute, if at all. However, as the industrial revolution led to the development of large industries, humans began to invent things that were not part of nature, thus the natural balance began to misbalance. This results in accumulation of garbage into the environment, resulting in pollution of the atmosphere, land and water sources. \n\nRecently, economic globalization has further increased the magnitude of environmental pollution and ensuing deterioration of public health. If the current trend is not reversed, planet Earth may eventually become uninhabitable. Therefore, the students registering in this course will:\n(1) learn the processes that facilitate generation and accumulation of garbage, \n(2) understand the mechanisms responsible for pollution of the Earth?s environment,\n(3) characterize the health effects of the polluted environment,\n(4) strategize remediation steps that may halt or repair the damage and \n(5) interpret data in writing and verbally.

The human-caused pollution of the environment (such as oil spill, poisonous gas leak, water pollution, global warming gas release, etc.) seriously impacts the health of millions of people and animals around the world. Despite such serious health consequences, people do not fully understand poisons or poisoning. In this course, students will learn some important aspects regarding poisons including, but not limited to the following.\n-What are poisons and what is poisoning? \n-Where do poisons come from?\n-What are the adverse effects of different types of poisons?\n-How to prevent poisoning?\n-What are the impacts of poisoning to the society?\nChemicals encountered in everyday life will be used as examples to evaluate the hazards and risk of exposure and put them into perspective. Students will learn the basic principles of toxicology, tools for assessing the toxicology of chemicals, effects of chemicals on the body, and why some people are more sensitive to chemicals than others.\n","prereq":[]},{"code":"VPM 1904","subject":"VPM","id":"1904","title":"Science, Technology & Society","info":"Have you seen the movie \\\"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes?\\\" A world where primates, not Homo sapiens, are at the top of the food chain. It takes place ten years after a lab's race to develop a cure for the Alzheimer disease resulted in genetically altered apes with heightened intelligence and a plague for the planet's humans. The \\\"Simian Flu,\\\" as it was called, reduced humanity to a meager million. Science or a fiction? Well! Twenty-five million people died just under five years between 1347 and 1352 due to plague. An estimated 400 million of Europe's population died of plague between 1000 and 1352. For perspective, in 1300 AD Earth's total population was 300 to 500 million and Europe's total population was 87 million. Today, our planet's and Europe's populations have fostered to 8 billion and 450 million, respectively. What if the plague returns in this interconnected planet with more than eight billion people where heightened conflict and denial of scientific theories persists? Science, technology, and society may hold the fate of humanity. The overall aim of this course is to examine the science-technology-society axis through the ages: a complex interplay among science, society, culture, religion and politics.\n\nThe aim of this course is to use the historical information to understand how science and technology affect social relations, and conversely how the culture of a society shapes the science and technologies it produces. Some of the questions this course will address are:\n-Do different technologies produce or result from different economic systems like feudalism, capitalism, and communism? \n-Can specific technologies promote democratic or authoritarian politics? \n-Do they suggest or enforce different patterns of race, class or gender relations? \n-How have the fields of science and technology evolved over time, and what does the future hold?  \n-How should societies manage those fields to achieve just and sustainable communities?","prereq":[]},{"code":"VPM 1905","subject":"VPM","id":"1905","title":"Freshman Seminar","info":"Freshman seminar.","prereq":[]},{"code":"VPM 1906W","subject":"VPM","id":"1906W","title":"Freshman Seminar","info":"Freshman Seminar","prereq":[]},{"code":"VPM 1907","subject":"VPM","id":"1907","title":"Contaminated Drinking Water","info":"The devastating lead contamination of the tap water in Flint, MI, a majority African-American city with a poverty rate above 40%, has drawn the nation's attention towards drinking water safety in the USA. Recently, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), an international nonprofit environmental organization, reported that in 2015 alone, over 18 million people were served by 5,363 community water systems that violated the Lead and Copper Rule set by the USEPA. Some of the violations cited were (i) failures to properly test the water for lead or conditions that could result in lead contamination, (ii) failures to report contamination to state officials or the public, and (iii) failures to treat the water appropriately to reduce corrosion. Additionally, 1,110 community water systems serving 3.9 million people showed lead levels in excess of 15 parts per billion (ppb) in at least 10 percent of the homes tested, the action level established for lead under the Lead and Copper Rule. \n\nGuardian launched an investigation in the wake of the toxic water crisis in Flint and found that at least 33 cities across 17 US states have used water testing \\\"cheats\\\" that potentially conceal dangerous levels of lead. As people, especially children, drink contaminated water, lead begins to build up in the body, often over a period of months or years. Even small amounts of lead can cause serious health problems. Children under the age of 6 are especially vulnerable to lead poisoning, which can severely affect mental and physical development. Therefore, lead contamination that was once considered an issue resolved has reappeared or been rediscovered. The overall goal of this course is to discuss the lead contamination issues in the American water supply and its health consequences. After completing this course, students will be able to:\n1. Explain physicochemical properties of lead in relation to other heavy metals.\n2. Describe the sources of lead in drinking water.\n3. Understand health consequences and possible treatment strategies of lead exposure in children and adults.\n4. The existing governmental and non-governmental regulation to detect and reduce lead contamination of drinking water.","prereq":[]},{"code":"VPM 1908","subject":"VPM","id":"1908","title":"Deep Ocean Mining & Ecosystems","info":"The environmental and ecosystem consequences of deep ocean floor mining (OFM) for resources will be discussed.
