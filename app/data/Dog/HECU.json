    "info": "The From Consumers to Creators course is a critical exploration of the role of storytelling and media in social change efforts. In this course will examine the ways that story is both a lens through which one understand the world and a tool which can be used to shape it. Students will have the opportunity to learn about and evaluate media-based activist strategies in the context of competing theoretical perspectives on media and society. Students will use theory and field experiences to reflect upon and hone their own digital practices as an effective agent of social change. This course is one of three required linked courses taken concurrently which make up the Making Media, Making Change Digital Technologies, Storytelling, and Activism program taught through our institutional partnership with HECUA and their community partner, the Twin Cities public access media powerhouse St Paul Neighborhood Network (SPNN), which provides technical training, equipment, and video production support. Students are also enrolled in HECU 3556 Digital Laboratory and enrolled in HECU 3558 Digital Media Internship where students can strengthen relationships with the diverse set of actors in the Twin Cities committed to using digital media to share their voices and build community. Interns contribute to public access and nonprofit programming and create professional quality video for community organizations in the Twin Cities. \n\nprereq: Departmental Consent Required.",

Student videography is expected to demonstrate both innovative content and high quality production. As part of this course, students will be trained by SPNN staff in camera operations, aesthetics of video production, shot composition, audio, lighting, and editing. Work will be graded with one's growing skill set in mind. Instructors will look for improvement in both the technical elements and the student's ability to create engaging and original work that reflects our focus on media that catalyzes social change. By the end of the semester students will be able to produce video suitable for public broadcast. While the coursework is integrated, we will spend most Wednesdays focused on the Digital Laboratory.

It will also equip students with the key theoretical tools for evaluating alternative policies and strategies for addressing various forms of poverty and inequality. Theory will be treated in an integrated fashion with students' field and internship work and will draw from numerous disciplines but with a particular focus on the field of political economy. Students examine a series of interrelated social systems relevant to the study of poverty and inequality such as the economy, the politics of economic policy, labor markets, geographic systems and housing, education and welfare systems. Theories of oppression help students understand how institutionalized racism, classism and gender discrimination factor in and among all of these systems.\n\nThis course is one of three courses taken concurrently that make up the Inequality in America: Policy, Community, and the Politics of Empowerment program taught through our institutional partnership with HECUA.

    "info": "The Internship and Integration Seminar is an 8 credit course comprised of two interconnected parts.. The internship is concentrated practice, and facilitates student learning on many levels. Students integrate and refine their theoretical understanding, build and develop skills, gain a greater understanding of methods of social change, and grow in their understanding of vocation. The program deliberately integrates these experiences with themes and experiences from the other courses in the program. Students work a minimum of 200 hours at their placement, approximately 20 hours each week for the duration of the program.\n\nThis seminar integrates theoretical and experiential work in the other seminars of the program with internship work, and provides further theoretical frameworks for making meaning from the internship experiences. Students analyze the operation of organizations that are dedicated to changing systemic inequalities, learn how, when, and why organizations collaborate, and explore the perspectives that internship organizations and staff bring to individual and societal change. Assignments ask students to articulate and assess worldviews on social change and movement-building, including; their own, those in texts discussed in the classroom, those expressed by field speakers who visit the program, and staff at their internship sites. Through guided examination of the assumptions they bring to interactions with practitioners and communities, students see how those varying worldviews play out within organizations and in processes of social change. Finally, students reflect on the impacts their classroom training and lived experiences have in real-world work and community environments, and articulate plans for their future engagement.\n\nThis course is one of three courses taken concurrently that make up the Inequality in America: Policy, Community, and the Politics of Empowerment program taught through our institutional partnership with HECUA.

    "info": "HECUA’s Race in America program poses the question: how are ordinary people moved to extraordinary action? For years, HECUA students have worked to address this question by examining The Black Freedom Movement of the 1950s and 60s, and more recently, Black Lives Matter — all from the perspective of the people and places of the American South. In response to the murder of George Floyd, and subsequent summer uprisings in our communities and across the country, HECUA is making the Race in America program a special Twin Cities-based offering for Summer 2021. As this program responds to this critical moment in the history of our community and nation, we will work to honor the thematic priorities of the Race in America program, including remote engagement with HECUA community partners in Mississippi and elsewhere in the South. \n\nThe Race in America-Twin Cities program examines the unique and destructive legacy of settler colonialism in Minnesota and its impacts on our Indigenous communities, later Black Minnesotans, and more recently, other communities of color, including new immigrants. Today, Minnesotans enjoy some of the highest quality of life indicators in the country. However, there are also staggering economic and educational disparities – some of the widest gaps in the US– between BIPOC Minnesotans and their White counterparts, particularly across urban communities. The murder of George Floyd and the summer uprisings of 2020 revealed to the world that racial and economic justice in Minnesota and across this nation are far from reality. Students in HECUA’s Race in America-Twin Cities program are introduced to a new generation of leaders who are working to meet critical challenges in education, policing and public safety, voting rights, environmental justice, and the establishment of a model for grassroots cooperative economics. Students will leave this program with a profound understanding of past and current movements for justice, new ways to examine issues of power and privilege, and a deeper understanding of their own capacity to make change.",

All field-based learning in the course takes place in partnership with community organizations and branches of government that are working actively as ecological stewards and promoting sustainability of human society and specific settlements with wise design.
