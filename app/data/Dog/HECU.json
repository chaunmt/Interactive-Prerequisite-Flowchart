minimum of 200 hours at their placement, approximately 20 hours each week for the duration of the program.\n\nthis seminar integrates theoretical and experiential work in the other seminars of the program with internship work, and provides further theoretical frameworks for making meaning from the internship experiences. students analyze the operation of organizations that are dedicated to changing systemic inequalities, learn how, when, and why organizations collaborate, and explore the perspectives that internship organizations and staff bring to individual and societal change. assignments ask students to articulate and assess worldviews on social change and movement-building, including; their own, those in texts discussed in the classroom, those expressed by field speakers who visit the program, and staff at their internship sites. through guided examination of the assumptions they bring to interactions with practitioners and communities, students see how those varying worldviews play out within organizations and in processes of social change. finally, students reflect on the impacts their classroom training and lived experiences have in real-world work and

the black freedom movement of the 1950s and 60s, and more recently, black lives matter — all from the perspective of the people and places of the american south. in response to the murder of george floyd, and subsequent summer uprisings in our communities and across the country, hecua is making the race in america program a special twin cities-based offering for summer 2021. as this program responds to this critical moment in the history of our community and nation, we will work to honor the thematic priorities of the race in america program, including remote engagement with hecua community partners in mississippi and elsewhere in the south. \n\nthe race in america-twin cities program examines the unique and destructive legacy of settler colonialism in minnesota and its impacts on our indigenous communities, later black minnesotans, and more recently, other communities of color, including new immigrants. today, minnesotans enjoy some of the highest quality of life indicators in the country. however, there are also staggering economic and educational disparities – some of the widest gaps in the us– between bipoc minnesotans and their white counterparts, particularly across urban communities. the murder of george floyd and the summer uprisings of 2020 revealed to the world that racial and economic justice in minnesota and across this nation are far from reality. students in hecua’s race in america-twin cities program are introduced to a new generation of leaders who are working to meet critical challenges in education, policing and public safety, voting rights, environmental justice, and the establishment of a model for grassroots cooperative economics. students will leave this program with a profound understanding of past and current movements for justice,
