    "info": "LGTT 3993 Directed Teaching with Technology, a variable credit directed study course (1-3 credits) taught by current Language Center instructors in tandem with a departmental language instructor and in collaboration with technologists and coordinators. The faculty for your course will provide you with an individualized contract and a syllabus for the term. This syllabus will outline your expectations for the class. This agreement must be approved by the Language Center Director. The number of credits awarded by the directed study will range from 1-3 depending on the number of contact hours per week between the instructor and student (i.e. meeting for 50 minutes per week for 1 credit, 100 minutes for 2 credits, 150 minutes for 3 credits). Contact hours may be in person or remote. The minimum expectation of your effort is 42 hours per credit. In order to enroll in the directed study, you will be required to fill out and use the campus-wide directed research/studies contract. \n\nThis course provides mentorship opportunities for undergraduate students in a highly contextualized experiential learning context and will increase students’ opportunities for success, retention, and skills development.\n\nThe contract will vary based on the language class format, number of credits, and your personal goals, but the course will include the following:\n\nCurated educational materials on language pedagogy and teaching with technology; documentation on the specific technology required for the class; structured, targeted training sessions; mentorship through the development of a capstone project or teaching portfolio; and opportunities for engagement with other learners and professionals in training.\n\nAt the end of the semester, you will submit a capstone project or teaching portfolio. The course grade will be based on participation and the quality of the project or portfolio, with rating criteria outlined in the individual contract.  ",
