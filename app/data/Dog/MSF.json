Finance concepts introduced in other courses are reinforced by having students build them into models and by having students interpret the results produced by those models. Students build a financial model on their own, learn to use a fully developed financial model and use models repeatedly to evaluate and plan performance, to estimate value added from projects, operating strategies and financing proposals and to estimate the value of securities.
