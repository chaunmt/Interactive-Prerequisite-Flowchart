The goal of this elective is for medical students to gain experience evaluating medically complex patients and optimizing them prior to their procedures.\n\nThis elective is geared towards medical students planning to go into the primary care fields, surgery, or anesthesiology.  Primary care physicians routinely perform the preoperative history and physical examinations for patients’ procedures.  They will gain a greater understanding of the anesthetic and procedural considerations that affect their patients. \n\nMedical students will work closely with the Preoperative Anesthesia Clinic faculty and anesthesiology residents.  Initially, the medical student will shadow residents/faculty, then they will progress to see patients independently and present to staff pertinent history and physical, assessment, and plan of action.  They will also assist in the coordination of the patient’s care which involves contacting primary care providers, surgical teams, and consultants.\n\nThe medical student will have the opportunity to follow select medically complex patients from a patient-centered, longitudinal perspective including coordination of care; application of evidence based, best practice protocols and pathways;  observation of the anesthetic care of the patient intraoperatively;  observation of the recovery and rehabilitation of the patient post operatively; and finally return of the patient to his or her primary care physician.  This is a unique, all encompassing view of a complex health care event not typically afforded trainees in traditional rotations.   \n\nOver the course of 4 weeks, the medical student will have ten one-on-one didactic sessions in journal club format with faculty to cover topics related to the pre-operative assessment including evaluation of cardiovascular risk and testing, pulmonary testing, diabetes, and frailty.
