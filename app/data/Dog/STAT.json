We will explore how charities and non-profits are using Big Data to improve charitable giving and access to resources for those who need it, how school districts and public charter schools are using Big Data to improve K-12 education, and finally we will explore how companies like Facebook and Google are using statistics and online Big Data to change modern cities and developing countries.

To tease out information from big data, one needs an understanding of \"what to compute\" and \"how to compute\":  the statistics and computer science arms of data science respectively. This class will initiate the development of such an understanding, as well as develop some computational skills in Python language, and scientific writing skill is LaTeX language. Python is a modern programming language, which is very popular in various industries dealing with large quantities of data. LaTeX is the principal language for writing mathematical and technical descriptions and research papers. We will discuss the basic principles that form the foundation of data science, and are central to modern statistics, machine learning and artificial intelligence. We will discuss how to quantify uncertainty, identify falsehood and develop scientific skepticism while analyzing data.",
