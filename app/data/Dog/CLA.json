Such a characterization paints Christians in unfairly broad strokes, ignoring their diversity of views. If the media portrayal is inaccurate, how does Christianity really interact with the issues we face in American society today? This is the theme we will explore in this course. We will focus our study on Christian beliefs as grounded in the Bible. We will see that Christians understand their holy book in different ways and come to very different conclusions about its application to societal issues. We will explore different Christian perspectives, noting how conservative and liberal Christians both ground their beliefs in biblical texts, yet hold opposing views. Gender, gay rights, abortion, and immigration are just a few of the topics we will explore as we investigate the interaction of Biblical Christianity with 21st century American issues.",

From a wide array of perspectives, we’ll seek to balance critical analysis with creativity as we attempt to understand how the concept of paradise has both inspired and oppressed. We will also pay special attention to how the College of Liberal Arts at the University of Minnesota has been imagined and shaped as a paradise over its 150-year history. The course will culminate with a collaborative public arts project organized by the students who will engage in the challenges of creating paradise.",

We will explore the relation between language, food, and identity in spontaneous conversations among people eating a variety of foods. The class will be most rewarding for students who like to cook and/or eat, talk about food, and educate their palate.",
