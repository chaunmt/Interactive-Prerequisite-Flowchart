Students will learn about, and reflect on, available food resources in Iceland, including how Icelandic cuisine is intertwined with Icelandic culture. \n\nActivities and learning will take place at numerous locations throughout Iceland. Students will attend lectures and presentations taught by faculty who are experts in the field, and will have the opportunity to learn about the culture and cuisine in Iceland. In their exploration of Iceland, students will be exposed to a breadth of diverse cultural experiences in which they will be challenged to reflect on their emotional responses and active participation within Icelandic culture and integrate these into their personal and professional worldview. \n\nStudents will also visit important archaeological, sacred, and natural sites throughout Iceland to better understand the history of the region and the culture of its people. Students will be encouraged early on to identify a particular interest they want to learn more about in Iceland (e.g. greenhouse agriculture, dairy production, sustainability, agro-tourism, etc.) and find opportunities to integrate this interest into the questions they ask in their blog posts, their final project, and at site visits.",

The intent of this course is for students to see science as a tool for understanding the world and solving problems. Importantly, the course is not designed to promote skills to become a practicing parasitologist but rather aims to facilitate broad exposure to infectious disease dynamics to foster more informed global citizens—using parasitic diseases as examples. A key tenet of liberal education is that it does not ignore the sciences, as such topics are explored in a way that intertwines science, history, and politics. Liberal education also teaches students how to speak their mind, how to write, and how to learn. As a result, this course will teach students how to use fundamental biological principles to think critically about challenges facing their society and the world.",

As a result, governments, corporations, consumers, and citizens will have to make deep meaningful changes to mitigating negative impacts to ecological biodiversity and natural resources.\n\nOf all sectors of the global economy, the agricultural and food sector is perhaps the most at risk. Producers within this industry are faced with the complicated equation being one of the principle causes of the problems listed above, while also retaining the responsibility to provide food for an ever-growing consumer base. Eating and good nutrition are vital human needs and food is a human right deeply rooted in culture and emotion. Food is a source of pleasure, a means of social integration, a reflection of cultural values, and of cultural identity. As a result, agrobusiness and food industry stakeholders are expected to meet the higher demand for food while also reassessing value chains, far beyond the classic economic and marketing approach, by introducing ecological, social, and cultural indicators when assessing operational standard and economic growth. \nis context, the idea of a terroir-driven food system represents strong sustainable alternative to standard commercial agricultural practices. While the term of terroir originates in western European countries such as Italy and France, the terroir approach is practiced worldwide. Terroir-centered food products, local food products, traditional food products, no matter what it is called, it is about the producing within a limited geographical area and producing products with unique characteristics recognizable to the people who live there. \n\nContent for this 4-week course, conducted in English, will be delivered via in-class lectures/presentations; educational field trips and cultural visits to Paris, the Loire Valley, Brittany, Normandy; group projects; and case studies.\n\nprereq: instr consent",

Our daily news is filled with reports on climate change, water scarcity and pollution, soaring energy costs, and food shortages. Solutions must consider environmental, economic, and social implications of our management strategies. Frequently there are trade-offs between benefits and costs. \n\nUniversity students as future leaders of business, government, and social programs should understand how to analyze environmental issues. What are the issues? Who is affected? What alternatives exist to solve them? What are the environmental, economic, and social trade-offs between these alternatives? What are reliable sources of information? How can each of us contribute to solutions?\n\nNew Zealand has undergone significant changes in its plant and animal composition following the invasion of humans and the exotic species they introduced. Alarmed by these changes, New Zealanders recently have made significant strides in recognizing environmental issues and seeking sustainable solutions. They offer valuable lessons for U.S. students to bring home and apply to our own environmental issues.",

Threats to ecosystem health in Borneo are multi-faceted. Habitat loss and fragmentation, due to logging a few decades ago and primarily now oil-palm agriculture, mean that wildlife populations are smaller and increasingly isolated. This class engages students in global issues of climate change and habitat loss, helping them explore and analyze their observations critically. It also brings students face-to-face with rehabilitation and reintroduction of the species that suffer most as forests are felled for logging followed by oil palm agriculture. Species we investigate most closely are orangutans and sun bears. We explore riparian habitat, discuss issues of fragmentation, and pressures on protected areas at the Danau Girang Field Centre (DGFC). DGFC is located in high-quality riparian habitat in the Kinabatangan Reserve, in patches of forest nestled in a matrix of oil-palm agriculture. This area is host to a truly incredible suite of wild species. The Kinabatangan River is home to clouded leopards, sun bears, orangutans, otters, proboscis monkeys, and crocodiles. At the field station, wild orangutans forage in the canopy overhead. If you follow the noise of rustling leaves, you will likely observe troops of long-tailed macaques moving in the canopy and hornbills feeding on forest fruits. Students learn wildlife monitoring techniques and design their own environmental education lesson. Students also connect issues of climate change and conservation in a range of ecosystems in Sabah, Borneo, and design enrichment projects for captive sun bears and orangutans.",

We will explore these issues in Akumal (Mayan: place of the turtle), Mexico on the Riviera Maya. Tourism and associated development have expanded exponentially in the past decade with subsequent effects on waste management and water quality in the local cenotes, groundwater, lagoons and reefs.  In addition to the water quality effects, increased use by tourist is also directly affecting sea grass, turtles and coral reefs.  We will explore the ecology of these systems, methods to assess their status and impacts, and strategies to reduce or mitigate the effects in a sustainable manner that involves local populations.\n\nPrereq: CFAN 3422",

    "info": "Co-production of sustainable knowledge: An exploration of human-wildlife conflict and a community artistic expression in southern Chile\n\nConservation biology addresses the tradeoffs inherent in balancing human needs for extractable ecosystem goods and services with our need for biodiversity and natural conditions. Our discussions always include the biophysical science of ecosystems and the human resource science of decisions. This class engages you directly in understanding and communicating about sustainable resource management in Patagonia, the fabulously beautiful, highly diverse, end-of-the-word in South America. You will explore mountainous and marine landscapes, places where you will (at least hope to see) Elephant seals, Mountain Lions, Emperor Penguins, Guanacos, and Patagonian Foxes. You also will encounter invasive rabbits and beavers, gigantic salmon aquaculture opens and an open pit mine. You will work with local community members to develop a permanent mural depicting all that. And you wll work with peers to develop a video documenting your experience.\n\nHumans have inhabited Patagonia for at last 14,000 years. For thousands of years, the nomadic Aónikenk people were the principal humans in the landscape. The technologically superior Mapuche people were predominant during the 1500s; Europeans (primarily Spanish and English) colonized the area from the mid-1500s; Chile has been an independent country since 1826. The economy of the area has been dominated by mining and agriculture. Mining extracts minerals and low quality coal. Agriculture includes sheep ranching as well as large scale marine salmon aquaculture. Sheep ranching resulted in thousands of miles of barbed wire fence, and millions of hectares of degraded grasslands, with associated negative impacts on wildlife. Wool prices were strong from the late 1800s through the mid 1950s, then dropped precipitously. As a result, many sheep estnacias were abandoned or turned into tourist lodges. Patagonia today is a land of expansive landscapes of mountains, grasslands, glaciers and high altitude lakes. The wildlife characteristic of the area include all Guanacos (a South American camel), the Huemel deer, Patagonian fox, hog nosed skunk and Andean Condor. Native marine life include penguins, elephant seals, leopard seals, and the Patagonian skate.",

    "info": "This embedded study abroad course will explore aspects of agriculture, food, and culture in Scandinavia in comparison to each student’s experience in the United States. This course will first meet on-campus, before our departure for a two-week experience in May.  \n\nIn English usage, Scandinavia can refer to Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, and sometimes used more broadly to include the Aland Islands, the Faroe Islands, Finland, and Iceland.  The use of the term Nordic can also include the aforementioned countries along with Finland and Greenland.\n\nThroughout this course, we will embark on an experience through hands-on learning in Denmark and Sweden. Students will learn about, and reflect on, available food resources in Scandinavia, including how Scandinavian cuisine is intertwined with Scandinavian culture.\n\nCFANS has partnered with DIS for this course.  DIS is a non-profit study abroad foundation established in Denmark in 1959, with locations in Copenhagen and Stockholm. DIS provides semester, academic year, and summer programs taught in English, and offers high-impact learning experiences for upper-division undergraduate students from distinguished North American colleges and universities. The intellectually challenging curriculum is broad, cutting edge, and enriched by experiential learning components, including faculty-led study tours across Europe. It provides students with opportunities for meaningful cultural engagement and personal growth, which is further enriched through housing and extracurricular offerings.\n\nActivities and learning will take place at numerous locations throughout Scandinavia. Students will attend lectures and presentations taught by faculty who are experts in the field, and will have the opportunity to learn about the culture and cuisine in Scandinavia. In their exploration of Scandinavia, students will be exposed to a breadth of diverse cultural experiences in which they will be challenged to reflect on their emotional responses and active participation within Scandinavian culture and integrate these into their personal and professional worldview. Students will also visit important archaeological, sacred, and natural sites throughout Scandinavia to better understand the history of the region and the culture of its people.\n\nStudents will be encouraged early on to identify a particular interest they want to learn more about in Scandinavia (e.g. precision agriculture, dairy production, sustainability, agro-tourism, etc.) and find opportunities to integrate this interest into the questions they ask in their blog posts, their final project, and at site visits.",

There are no course prerequisites and all instruction is in English. New Zealand is a modern country with friendly people and awesome scenery.\n\nOur daily news is filled with reports on climate change, water scarcity and pollution, soaring energy costs, and food shortages.   Solutions must consider environmental, economic, and social implications of our management strategies. Frequently there are tradeoffs between benefits and costs. University students as future leaders of business, government, and social programs should understand how to analyze environmental issues. What are the issues? Who is affected? What alternatives exist to solve them? What are the environmental, economic, and social tradeoffs between these alternatives? What are reliable sources of information? How can each of us contribute to solutions?\n\nNew Zealand has undergone significant changes in its plant and animal composition following the invasion of humans and the exotic species they introduced. Alarmed by these changes, New Zealanders recently have made significant strides in recognizing environmental issues and seeking sustainable solutions. They offer valuable lessons for U.S. students to bring home and apply to our own environmental issues.",
