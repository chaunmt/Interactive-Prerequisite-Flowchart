Importantly, the course is not designed to promote skills to become a practicing parasitologist but rather aims to facilitate broad exposure to infectious disease dynamics to foster more informed global citizens—using parasitic diseases as examples.

Producers within this industry are faced with the complicated equation being one of the principle causes of the problems listed above, while also retaining the responsibility to provide food for an ever-growing consumer base. Eating and good nutrition are vital human needs and food is a human right deeply rooted in culture and emotion. Food is a source of pleasure, a means of social integration, a reflection of cultural values, and of cultural identity. As a result, agrobusiness and food industry stakeholders are expected to meet the higher demand for food while also reassessing value chains, far beyond the classic economic and marketing approach, by introducing ecological, social, and cultural indicators when assessing operational standard and economic growth. \nis context, the idea of a terroir-driven food system represents strong sustainable alternative to standard commercial agricultural practices. While the term of terroir originates in western European countries such as Italy and France, the terroir approach is practiced worldwide. Terroir-centered food products, local food products, traditional food products, no matter what it is called, it is about the producing within a limited geographical area and producing products with unique characteristics recognizable to the people who live there.

    "info": "This seminar explores tropical conservation by focusing on three main themes in Borneo: climate change, rehabilitation and release of charismatic rare and endangered species, and remote camera surveys for environmental education. Each theme is supported with in-country lectures, exploration activities, and a student product. We explore and learn about marine, montane, and tropical forest ecosystems. Threats to ecosystem health in Borneo are multi-faceted. Habitat loss and fragmentation, due to logging a few decades ago and primarily now oil-palm agriculture, mean that wildlife populations are smaller and increasingly isolated. This class engages students in global issues of climate change and habitat loss, helping them explore and analyze their observations critically. It also brings students face-to-face with rehabilitation and reintroduction of the species that suffer most as forests are felled for logging followed by oil palm agriculture. Species we investigate most closely are orangutans and sun bears. We explore riparian habitat, discuss issues of fragmentation, and pressures on protected areas at the Danau Girang Field Centre (DGFC). DGFC is located in high-quality riparian habitat in the Kinabatangan Reserve, in patches of forest nestled in a matrix of oil-palm agriculture. This area is host to a truly incredible suite of wild species. The Kinabatangan River is home to clouded leopards, sun bears, orangutans, otters, proboscis monkeys, and crocodiles. At the field station, wild orangutans forage in the canopy overhead. If you follow the noise of rustling leaves, you will likely observe troops of long-tailed macaques moving in the canopy and hornbills feeding on forest fruits. Students learn wildlife monitoring techniques and design their own environmental education lesson. Students also connect issues of climate change and conservation in a range of ecosystems in Sabah, Borneo, and design enrichment projects for captive sun bears and orangutans.",
