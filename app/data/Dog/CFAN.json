    "info": "this seminar explores tropical conservation by focusing on three main themes in borneo: climate change, rehabilitation and release of charismatic rare and endangered species, and remote camera surveys for environmental education. each theme is supported with in-country lectures, exploration activities, and a student product. we explore and learn about marine, montane, and tropical forest ecosystems. threats to ecosystem health in borneo are multi-faceted. habitat loss and fragmentation, due to logging a few decades ago and primarily now oil-palm agriculture, mean that wildlife populations are smaller and increasingly isolated. this class engages students in global issues of climate change and habitat loss, helping them explore and analyze their observations critically. it also brings students face-to-face with rehabilitation and reintroduction of the species that suffer most as forests are felled for logging followed by oil palm agriculture. species we investigate most closely are orangutans and sun bears. we explore riparian habitat, discuss issues of fragmentation, and pressures on protected areas at the danau girang field centre (dgfc). dgfc is located in high-quality riparian habitat in the kinabatangan reserve, in patches of forest nestled in a matrix of oil-palm agriculture. this area is host to a truly incredible suite of wild species. the kinabatangan river is home to clouded leopards, sun bears, orangutans, otters, proboscis monkeys, and crocodiles. at the field station, wild orangutans forage in the canopy overhead. if you follow the noise of rustling leaves, you will likely observe troops of long-tailed macaques moving in the canopy and hornbills feeding on forest fruits. students learn wildlife monitoring techniques and design their own environmental education lesson. students also connect issues of climate change and conservation in a range of ecosystems in sabah, borneo, and design enrichment projects for captive sun bears and orangutans.",
