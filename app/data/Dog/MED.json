means to be human. plagues have also shaped our literature. while it is essential that we consult the latest research in infection control and treatment, we are wise to read classic and modern literature for the profound insight it has to offer. from camus’ the plague to crichton’s the andromeda strain, from shakespeare’s king lear to dante’s divine comedy, this rotation offers timeless readings from classic and modern literature. not only will we study and discuss literary reflections on plagues, but more importantly we will broadly consider our reaction to times of great trial. as physicians and human beings, what is our duty (or vocation) in deeply uncertain times? how are we to comprehend and cope with suffering? where will we find the profound and subtle graces amidst public and personal calamity? in the end, what does great literature have to teach us? for medical students and clinicians navigating the covid-19 pandemic, to answer these questions is to better prepare ourselves to serve our patients while sustaining ourselves with the deeper reasons behind our work. \n\nover four weeks, readings in great literature (books, essays, and excerpts) will be assigned weekly. readings should be read and students should be prepared to discuss them in advance of each small group discussion. weekly small group zoom discussion (assigned group of 4-5) will happen on
