    "info": "This course is an invitation to meet and engage with the field of Youth Studies. This is an introductory course to a subject you already know about – you’ve lived its content; thought about it; you may even written poems, made a video or posted a meme about this life-moment. Since you know this so well, why take a university course on it? You will leave this course better able to notice the young people around you; wonder about them and their lives; name, describe and analyze what you see and hear and read about youth. This course is about all young people. This means that we are attentive to including material about youth from diverse backgrounds, many ethnic/racial, social class, linguistic, and geographic locations or those who have a variety of physical and mental capacities, those who are “normal” and “typical” and those who are “not”. Together, we will examine myths and stereotypes about youth, where they come from, and how to deconstruct them using a variety of lenses-- social, popular and news media, young adult novels, academic articles, biographies, and more. We will do this through engaging class discussions and activities. You will learn how to use critical ethnography “in the field” where you will observe and write about youth in a variety of settings including malls, sporting events, busses, coffee shops, and music venues. We believe that an introductory college course is a space and time to reflect, analyze, and learn about what matters to you, about who you are and about the work others have done and what you want to do. In these ways, this course introduces ways of being an engaged and thoughtful student, citizen and professional, all of which require critical thinking skills and an ability to work across difference and diversity. In this course, students will develop skills in assessment, reflection/reflexivity, deconstruction, empathy and judgement; all precursors for professional decision-making in careers like youth work, policy, public health, education, communications, and other fields. We hope this course may lead to reflecting on your occupational future and vocational call.",

    "title": "Stories of Resistance & Change",
    "info": "This course imagines literature as an opportunity to complement other understandings of youth, and to help those who work with children and adolescents to better understand their lived experiences. We will read classic and contemporary literary texts that respond to the needs, wants, and existential questions that surround young people’s lives, and makes them visible to learners in the class who want to better understand children and adolescents in diverse settings across the United States. Youth Studies at the University of Minnesota, prepares students to work towards understanding and helping to improve the everyday lives of diverse youth. By being in this class, reading our course texts carefully, and by engaging in learning activities with classmates, students have the chance to take away new understandings from powerful stories about youth. In fact, the texts in this course contain important descriptions of how oppression looks and feels to young people as they navigate institutions and see the impacts of structural inequality on themselves, communities, families, and friends. The young people in these texts show tremendous agency, and show meaningful examples of resistance on large and small scales. We will work together with course texts about how young people challenge and are challenged by their surroundings, and take away new meanings about how young people have promoted social justice and change. ",
    "prereqInfo": "Learning activities in this class will include reading, writing, quizzes and exams and a course project. In class learning activities include discussion, presentations, activities, and a high level of participation is expected. Why literature? Literature can be thought of as one way of knowing about the daily lives of youth. Because literature offers a rich detailed framework of meaning showing the diverse contexts of lives of children, teenagers and young adults, youth workers can use the tools of literature to make youth work meanings from literature in which young people are primary to the text. Literature can make up a new lens through which learners can understand the daily and everyday lives of youth, and can complement the important social science lenses you may already bring to the class. Students are encouraged to develop a new set of questions about youth as they use the formal tools of literature to read literary texts that represent a range of styles, formats, themes, and choices. Diversity and Social Justice Literature that centers on young people from multicultural settings offers an opportunity to think about what it is that students already know about youth from diverse backgrounds, and to question whether their understanding is correct or if there are gaps in knowledge. In other words, a course goal will be to identify epistemological gaps between what we think we know about youth, race, gender, and power and privilege, and how that is confirmed and/or made more complicated by a larger body of knowledge about social constructions of power and privilege. This course calls on our literary texts to challenge and deconstruct dominant narratives about youth and their communities. Learners in this course enter into an ongoing conversation about what social justice for youth means in the context of unequal distribution of power and constructions of privilege and oppression.",

    "info": "This course uses literature by a diverse array of global authors as a window into youth experience and representation. We identify dominant narratives constructed through education, culture, religion, and media, and examine how authors and readers offer counternarratives. We work within social justice and decolonizing frameworks to understand how global power relations and our own perspectives are shaped by U.S. and European imperialism. We embrace the liberatory and expressive possibilities of narrative, while also recognizing the constraints exercised by the publishing industry and English language dominance. Literature opens up conversations about the lived experiences of youth. It invites us to empathize with experiences beyond our own, and provides an opportunity to highlight how cultural contexts shape interpretation. Together we will read, reflect, and analyze global texts by, for, and about youth. Accountability for readings takes the form of quizzes and reading responses. Students build skills of critical analysis through writing assignments, examining the array of choices authors make and the impact they have on audiences. Class is structured as a collaborative and interactive experience, with an emphasis on small group activities and participation.",

    "info": "This course explores issues faced by youth, especially those who live in or are characterized by our understanding of urban areas. We explore by asking questions like: “Which youth are labeled as 'urban' and by whom”? “What has contributed to notions of ‘urban’ and ‘suburban’\\\"? \\\"What are the associated myths and stereotypes”? and “How are urban communities policed and what are the consequences of this policing”? We will critically examine what the term “urban youth” means, how it has evolved over time and place, its relationship to power and privilege, and its use as a “code word” with implicit associations of race, poverty, and violence. Using a critical Youth Studies framework, which engages with the role of historical, social, cultural, geographical, and political contexts, we seek to understand how each of these axes of power-relations influence the opportunities and struggles of young people, their interaction with institutions and the construction of their identities in particular places. This class is a part of the Community Engaged Learning (CEL) program. Students will combine direct work with youth in the community with classroom learning. The objective is for students to make valuable contributions to communities, gain practical experience and apply the knowledge gained in the classroom to their service learning work. Students will also be able to discuss, reflect and write about their community –engaged experiences. This class offers a unique opportunity to engage with diverse youth in different settings thus gaining valuable skills that can be useful for future professional practice in many fields including, education, recreation, mental health, and youth work.

Through experience, you will learn about the importance of place and history in experiential education; multiple theories and practices of experiential education, including the Learning Cycle Theory and educative and mis-educative experiences; methods of reflection and assessment, group facilitation, leadership skill development in youth; values curiosity and the outdoors.

Exploring various historic and philosophical origins of “normal” childhood, we unveil the way our modern understandings of child, youth, and adolescent draw upon a rich history of sexist, colonialist, and racist science. To do so we explore Indigenous, early European, Middle-Class, and W.E.I.R.D. (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic) notions of childhood. We explore how these ideas are operationalized into practices on youth/youthwork. We explore how contemporary organizations of American youthwork and youth development, then took up and applied these ideas thus naturalizing modern norms and expectations of child and youth. This course covers the philosophical and historical foundations of youthwork in a critical and interactive way through a review of youth, youthwork, and youth organizations set in the context of the past 500 years.

    "prereqInfo": "The course is designed to encourage students to examine their familial histories, timelines and geographies and through collaborative and interactive learning, begin to explore how these histories, combined with others, helped to shape the ways that we think about youth and how this thinking collectively shapes youth policy, practice, and the institutions within which we meet and work with young people. All of this with the goal of becoming more effective and thoughtful when working with young people in youthwork settings. Whether you choose to work in youthwork settings or in other human service organization or agency, developing a sense of cultural humility and skills to understand historical data, philosophical frames and current practices will be critical to your success in professional arenas.

You have first hand experience that can be used to interrogate the theories and often illustrate both the strengths and weaknesses of each. Over the course of the semester, we describe, discuss, and critique six theories of adolescent and youth development, including: Social Justice Youth Development, Participatory Youth Development, Community Youth Development, Positive Youth Development, Adolescent Development, and Recapitulation. We begin with the most recent theory and then using academic archeology, dig back through time to understand not only the individual theories but also how they connect and join to each other. Along the way, we also discuss the social and cultural events and situations that influenced each theory’s development and often demise. A major goal of this class is to better understand where these theories come from, what they are connected to, and often how they are used to both support and marginalize young people. ",

The occupational title, youth worker, is not widely recognized with a set of knowledge, skills, and attitudes that distinguish it from other occupations that work with young people (teacher, coach, social worker).  Often youth worker is taken to signify those who “work with youth.”  In recent years there have been attempts to clarify and specify what a youth worker does, whom a youth worker should be, and how one should be educated for this type of work.  These debates now occur within international and national movements to “professionalize” youth work.  In this course, we enter this conversation by considering the multiple ways of becoming, being a youth worker, and doing youth work.  Toward the end of the course, we will also explore how context—agency, street, and neighborhood—can have consequences on all three of these.",

Some of the most important and most challenging work you face as you near graduation in your major is the work of bringing your academic training to bear on current issues in your field of study. By focusing on project-based writing, this course supports undergraduate learners in the endeavor to delve into and contribute to the work being done in your field to address a particular problem. You will propose a project, identify an audience, tailor your work to address your audience’s needs, gather relevant information through primary and secondary research, and create a product that engages others and furthers the real-world work of solving problems. Collaborative activities and assignments will support you through the process. The course structure is flexible and designed to be responsive to individual needs and a variety of disciplinary contexts, so that students can receive feedback and guidance during different stages of capstone or thesis writing, or community engagement projects. Thus, you can anticipate that the majority of the work will focus on a project that you will propose based on your interests, needs, or connections to your writing work in your major. Course goals are to develop a writing process, understand the habits of writings, work through a larger research project, develop skill in the APA format, learn to use the University libraries, consider audience needs. In class work include: peer review, active learning activities designed around writing skill development, discussion, lecture, and presentation. Learners are expected to actively engage in the course material, participate in class and give and receive feedback about writing. ",

Professional staff learn to read and understand these youth primarily as students and less so as youth. Typically, educators learn some about adolescent development and psychology, about what is typical and common of young people in middle and high school. They also learn some about youth who are troubled, troubling, and in trouble. By and large, educators are practical folk who study and use “practical knowledge” so as to better teach and otherwise serve their students. This course intends to enrich the knowledge of school professionals in two ways: ",
    "prereqInfo": "One, contribution will be centered focus on youth people and their life-worlds, in school, outside, and between the two, e.g. family, work lives, play lives, spiritual lives, friendship lives, etc. The second is a focus on youthwork as a craft orientation and occupation. In this view, most professional educators can approach some of their work as youthworkers, and they can work with designated youthworkers from the school and from community agencies in the service of young people and the school. The goals are more effective service for young people through deeper understanding of these persons and, reciprocally we believe, less existential burnout by educators, i.e. a loss of personal meaning in their work.",

The course ends by describing and developing an understanding of youth work in current and post-violently divided societies internationally, such as Northern Ireland, Palestine, South Africa, and India.  Veena Das’ work in India around social suffering, will be used to frame the work and understand the overall aims and goals of community based youth work in such places.

One purpose of the course is to explore youth work practice in contexts marked by suffering, loss, and violence.",

Society relies on the family group to provide for the economic and protective needs of individuals, especially children and the elderly (1984, 2003). The stories, behaviors, dynamics, attitudes, and habits of families shape the identity and experience of young people. To understand and respect young people, and to participate in the creation of environments for healthy youth development, youth workers must learn how to understand and respect the role their families play in their everyday lives.

Many people who invest time or money in youth programs request program evaluation. As the emphasis on quality continues, youth workers will be expected to support evaluation, at minimum, and may also be asked to manage evaluation projects, either working with an internal or external evaluator, or doing evaluation as part of their job. Youth work positions now typically include these roles, regardless of settings. Evaluation can support ongoing professional development for youth workers. This course emphasizes how evaluation and applied research supports professional development and strengthens overall quality in youth programs. Evaluation and applied research provide frameworks and tools that support youth workers to describe, analyze, synthesize, and better understand how they can create high quality programs and support high quality practice for all young people. Evaluation is considered as both a tool- and a site for- critically examining issues of equity and social justice. The course includes readings and discussion on the social justice implications of evaluation and explores culturally responsive evaluation frameworks. During the feedback process for each stage of evaluation, a social justice lens is used to examine and critique the stage’s process and outcomes. ",

Students will both learn about evaluation and applied research as well as do it!

    "info": "This course starts with the idea that research should be conducted inside and outside the walls of academia. At a basic level, youth workers conduct research everyday – even if they don’t consider it “formal” research. We all have questions about what is going on in the everyday lives of young people – and we all seek deeper understanding. Given that, there may be an ethical requirement to carefully consider the data used to understand young people. Historically and currently, research with young people is being “done to” and “not with” young people. And often, that data is used to both shape our perceptions of what it is to be a young person and the policies that affect their daily lives. For example, consider what data on emotional regulation is commonly used and how that has shaped suspension policies in schools? Youth workers are often advocates for youth, but they may not consider research about young people as places for action and resistance. ",
    "prereqInfo": "Students will begin class by exploring the purpose, definitions and methods of research most commonly used in youth work, with an emphasis on qualitative research as a process highly relevant to daily practice. Students will review a variety of perspectives on research that encourage a more critical eye on subjectivity, the social/political contexts around data and the acknowledgement from indigenous research methods that a researcher must articulate their relationship to the research question. This course will then move students through a full research experience from a problem to questions, from purpose to methods, towards data collection, analysis, writing and presentation, as a beginning researcher. Quite a challenge, so expect it to be imperfect and messy. ",
