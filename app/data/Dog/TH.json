This course engages with these debates to understand the power of new media to shape our identities and values, our cultural habits and communities, our economy and political life. We discuss how we “perform ourselves” through media, giving rise to social anxieties about truth, authenticity, equality, and belonging, but also to tremendous opportunities for self-expression and connection. And we investigate how our performances are monetized or instrumentalized by governments, social movements, or corporations. How did our current media system develop, and whose interests has it served? How, for better or worse, has the social media age changed us and the world we live in? And how can we make sure that in the future that change is for the better?",

Theater plays and films about cyborgs invest them with feelings, and question their exploitation by humans. Meanwhile, contemporary drones and robots are programmed with data drawn from humans, and evoke different fears of machines taking over the planet. We compare cyborg and hacking cultures to see how human and artificial intelligence engage with each other, and how their battles shape our concepts of intention and responsibility.",

By focusing on a critical examination of this and similar questions, this course will investigate how performance events from the Ancient Greece to the French Revolution are brought to our attention, how they are made worthy of notice, and how they are rationalized as significant for theatre and performance history. By studying the theories of the Western origins of theatre and drama, the censoring of creative activities in the Ancient Rome or in the Renaissance England, the appearance of female actors and playwrights in Restoration, and the fashioning of a new economic type the eighteenth century, this course will ask: what are the consequences today of using or promoting these and not other representational practices?",

We will discuss how theatre makers and thinkers responded to this call by offering playtexts and performance practices which challenged mainstream theatre in the era of the revolutions in time and space—Naturalism, Symbolism, Futurism, Dada, Surrealism; Agit-Prop, Theatre of the Oppressed, Theatre for Social Change; Black, Feminist, Queer Theatres; and Pixelated Revolutions. We will investigate histories, politics, and aesthetics of theatre and performance in a variety of cultural and ideological contexts. While reviewing these representational practices, which materialize as play-texts, performances, theatre architecture, theatre rebellions and regulations, theoretical writings, etc., we will discuss how they were produced, given intelligibility, and disseminated.  One may ask: what are the consequences of using or promoting these and not other representational practices? How are performance events brought to our attention by the past and present imaginations? How are they made worthy of notice are rationalized as significant for theatre history.",

The course will be a 3-week long study abroad course with pre-departure readings and films, on-site readings and activities, and a final project due upon return.\nAustralia is an isolated place considered to be on the \\\"edge of the world,\\\" simultaneously the oldest continent and a young civil society. It is a place evocative of wild stunning landscape, exotic wildlife, and a history as a convict colony. Since the birth of the Australian film industry in the 1950's Australian filmmakers have sought to tell their own stories and to interrogate the idea of Australian culture. The global success of films such as Mad Max, Crocodile Dundee, and Priscilla Queen of the Desert have served to reinforce and disrupt stereotypes of Australia as a place and culture. In contrast, films such as Rabbit Proof Fence, Animal Kingdom and The Sapphires seek to tell alternative narratives. Themes such as the urban and rural divide, conquering nature, the place in society of indigenous communities, and fatalism are interrogated\nSimilarly, Australian writers such as Colleen McCullugh, Kate Grenville, Tim Winton, and Liane Morriarty have gained international readership. Their novels, as well as others, use landscape and storytelling to create and challenge simplistic ideas of Australian history and culture.\nBy studying the history and works engaged in creating and interpreting this idea of Australian identity, from Australian artists, students will be asked to engage in a more complex way with the ideas of heritage, culture, and national identity in general. Students will also read selected essays on Australian history and culture. The IDI (Intercultural Development Inventory) will also be used as a tool to engage with the dialogue on identity and culture in general.",

The plays and essays will be read against the background of significant cultural, social and literary movements - the Civil Rights Movement, Cold War politics, the Women’s Movement, Gay Liberation, the Culture Wars, post-modernism, deconstruction, multiculturalism, afro-futurism, etc. as well as the evolution of identity nomenclature and racial classification from Colored to Negro to Black to African American. In addition to play analysis and criticism, students will garner a knowledge of significant Black cultural institutions and their impact on the ever-changing American theatre landscape.",

Critical literacy is the focus; theater and storytelling are the vehicles. Key topics to be covered include: 1) A historical background on fairy and folk tales, legends, fables, myths, and the different oral traditions; 2) Tools for developing a critical view of diverse tales; 3) Practical instruction on how to use storytelling and story genres in the classroom to develop critical literacy; 4) Assessing storytelling work in the classroom. Students will meet in the first week at the University to learn tools of the Neighborhood Bridges program and in the second week will practice and observe each other?s teaching with local school classrooms. In the past we have worked with 4th graders and 6th graders, though we will also discuss how course content applies to high school students. The class meets for two intensive weeks in person, however, we additionally assign pre-readings and post-class reflections and papers.",
