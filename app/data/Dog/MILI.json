    "info": "The healthcare marketplace constitutes over three trillion dollars in the United States and several trillion spent throughout the world.  With growing demand for medical technology and the aging of the population, the scale and complexity of the healthcare supply chain is expected to dramatically increase over the next two decades.  The healthcare sector is comprised of several markets for goods and services, including physician services, hospital services, insurance, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and information technology.  At the core of it all is healthcare consumers: us as patients, patient family members and caregivers. This course aims to 1) provide a historical evolution and social transformation of the healthcare sector, 2) critically review the current survey of the health economy, 3) discuss new health policy and reform initiatives and compare to international health system models. The overall goal is to provide an understanding of the scale and interactions between different health sector markets and consumers; to identify market opportunities and policy initiatives, as well as barriers to this expanding and global industry.",

    "info": "Course Description\nInnovations in medical technologies are one of the leading areas of economic growth in the world. Whether new technologies take the form of pharmaceutical, medical device, biotechnology, information technology of some combination of these innovations, the opportunities for both private enterprise and social welfare are substantial. However, these innovations are not without cost, and require reimbursement from either a privately or publicly financed health care delivery system. Thus, the demand for the evaluation of new medical technologies continues to grow as new treatments are developed and health care costs continue to rise. This course aims to provide knowledge of the skills, data, and methodology required to critically evaluate new medical technologies from a social perspective as well as from a business perspective in order to meet financial investment and regulatory compliance objectives. The course will provide an introduction to the analytic tool kit needed to critically evaluate new medical technologies including:\n1.\tUnderstanding regulatory pathways such as the FDA approval\n2.\tUnderstanding the U.S. payment policy & reimbursement for medical technology\n3.\tAssessing unmet needs and the relevant market for the technology\n4.\tEvaluating the social and economic value to convince payers to cover and reimburse the technology\n5.\tRecognizing provider, healthcare organization and market-level factors that influence adoption of new medical technologies.
