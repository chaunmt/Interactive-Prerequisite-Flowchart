This introductory course explores both the enduring challenges of international politics as well as more recent transformative trends. The course introduces theoretical traditions, but its focus is on making sense of real-world problems, both today and in the past. Why is the world organized into states, and what implications does the states system have for indigenous populations globally? Why and when do states go to war and use military force? Why do they sign international agreements and treaties, on matters from arms control to investment? In what ways do existing systems of international law and trade exacerbate or mitigate global inequities? Why has human rights emerged as a central problem in world politics? What are the prospects for international cooperation to address climate change? How have inequities and prejudices, along the lines of race and other categorical identities, shaped our world - from the practice of global security to the structures of the international political economy? These are among the pressing real-world questions that this course in Global Politics will address and that it will give you the tools to answer - though particular instructors will naturally emphasize different topics and questions. But the course will also highlight how our answers to these questions are changing along with the deep power structures of global politics - as US dominance wanes and others, most notably China, rise; as core ideas and discourses underpinning the international system, such as sovereignty, come under assault; as institutions, such as those governing international law, thicken; and as attention grows to the structuring effects of race and other ascriptive categories. Global Politics is an essential guide to our increasingly globalized world.",

These are the questions that this class tackles. For example, we'll ask: why does the United States play such an active role in world politics? Might this change in the future and has the United States always behaved in this way? Why is the United States so often at war despite being so militarily powerful and secure? What role has race and racism played in key episodes of U.S. foreign policy? Does the rise of China pose a threat to the United States and if so, what should the United States do about it? Why does the United States care so much about stopping other countries from acquiring nuclear weapons? Should addressing climate change be a key priority of U.S. foreign policy and how should it be addressed?",

Starting from such basic concerns as the nature of politics, humans, power and justice, political theorists explore how these basic starting assumptions organize the norms, practices, and institutions of political and social order. To explore these topics, the field turns to key texts, as well as to political and social events and other media (film, historical documents, etc.). In this introductory course, students will investigate some of the basic texts in political theory, with the goal of learning how to read texts more analytically and to address fundamental questions in political theory. Among the topics that might be the nature of justice and injustice, political obligation and civil disobedience, democracy and other forms of governance. Students who complete this course will understand the deep issues about the nature of politics, will have learned to read and to analyze complex texts. They will also have had the opportunity to reflect upon their own ethical engagement in political life and upon the ways in which historically, political ideas change.",

After illuminating some important current issues about trade and monetary affairs, including recent efforts to restrict trade with China and China’s effort to promote economic development through its Belt and Road Initiative, we study the post-World War II evolution of the global trading and monetary systems. This includes evaluating some contending theoretical perspectives about these systems. Then we analyze the politics of trade. Among the topics singled out for close study are the distributional consequences of trade, particularly, how trade produces skill and occupational cleavages within democratic countries and, in turn, these cleavages produce populism. Institutions for governing trade like the World Trade Organization also are studied. The effects of monetary flows—both of currency and capital—are examined next. Topics in this part of the class include the American Federal Reserve as a world lender of last resort, the reasons why countries adopt the U.S. dollar as their currency, the demand for and consequence of direct foreign investment, and the workings and activities of the World Bank. In the closing weeks of the class we take a closer look at trade and monetary developments in Asia, Latin America, and Africa. The recent claim that developing countries are falling into to Chinese financed “debt trap” is studied in these weeks.",

It might also focus on a broader theme such as: conceptions of destiny, mission, and exceptionalism; arguments over economic development and inequality; or debates over government and corporate power. The course will begin with Puritan religious and political thought, tracing its secularization over time. Considerable attention will be paid to the ideas behind the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, such as the social contract and the right of resistance to civil authority, civic republicanism, and the founders’ new science of politics and government. The course will consider some if not all of the following: debates over slavery and emancipation, women’s rights, the rise of imperialism and nationalism, race and racism, and the rise of rule by public and private bureaucratic organizations, and the consequences of these developments for the possibility of continued individual liberty, equality, and justice. This course requires considerable reading of difficult texts. The ultimate goal of this course is for students to gain a deeper understanding of American political thought as a product of the country’s ever-evolving political discourse. prereq: Suggested prerequisite POL 1201",

Topics will include: the centrality of social movements for democracies; deliberative and participatory democracy; as well as questions about how members of political communities can best participate in democratic life to address structural inequalities. Students will write a longer essay that allows them to demonstrate their capacities to understand and explain complex ideas and to make a theoretically compelling argument, using appropriate supporting evidence.",

This course offers students an opportunity to return to the foundations of this vocabulary by delving into work by such major thinkers as Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, and Machiavelli. Lectures and discussion shall consider the endurance of certain basic questions of political life, such as: What is justice? What is the best regime? What is the relationship between human nature and political order? Can politics be virtuous and, if so, in what way? The course will also consider the radically diverse responses to these essential questions through examination of a wide range of historical periods and the unique terms of political order each offered. Previous iterations of the course have included examination of the Classical Greek city-state system and its fragile experiments with democracy; the rise and fall of the Roman empire; the establishment of Western Christendom; the Renaissance, so-called discovery of the New World, and dawn of the modern era. Students will gain a glimpse into worlds preoccupied by matters of truth, virtue and nobility, but also widely populated by slavery, imperialism, violence, and religious strife. In this way, the study of ancient theory is intended to serve as both supplement and challenge to the terms of contemporary political life.",

These changes posed extraordinary challenges to usual ways of conceiving of political order and governance. Our course this semester will read these changes through three key concepts – revolution, democracy, and empire. Class discussion will seek to understand different meanings of these concepts, their political stakes, and ways of knowing how to move between political ideals and historical examples. Students will read a range of materials – from primary historical sources, to philosophic texts, political pamphlets and treatises, and travel journals – so as to study the effects on both the European context and beyond.",

This course will examine these events, the political and ethical challenges they raised, and the intellectuals who shaped the ensuing public debates.

Even if we can all vote, but if people are still hungry, we will not be free. Remember, we are not fighting for the freedom of the Negro alone, but for the freedom of the human spirit, a larger freedom that encompasses all mankind.\\\"",

    "info": "What role does education play in American democracy? What role should it play? Does American education, particularly public education, live up to its citizens hopes and expectations? And, perhaps most importantly, what do we mean by a good education? This is a question with deep historical roots in this country, one that is the subject of current policy debates and one that cannot be separated from questions of discrimination and inequality. The over-arching theme of the course is to wrestle with what it means to be an educated citizen in the context of historical struggles to achieve that vision in the face of multiple and inter-related inequalities and competing visions about how to make the American dream a reality in the field of public education. No one political perspective will be offered or favored. No magic powder will be revealed on the last day of the course. The fact is that the underlying issues are really complicated, often seemingly intractable, and very, very political. This course is intended as introduction to education politics and policy in the United States. It will focus on K-12 education, especially in the public system. It is designed for any student who might have an interest in exploring education, public policy, or American government. Topics will include equality of educational opportunity, educating democratic citizens, school finance, the role of political institutions in making educational policy, and efforts to reform and remake American education, including charter schools, private school vouchers, and standardized testing. By the end of the course, students should have a basic understanding of the provision of public education in the United States, including the ways in which education is governed and the institutions involved in that governance. Students should be able to critically reflect on the degree to which American education fulfills the sometimes-competing goals Americans have for their schools. This course fulfills the Social Sciences Core of the University liberal education requirements. In this course students will act as policy analysts, with all of the complexity that such a task entails in the field of American public education. This course also fulfills the Diversity and Social Justice in the United States theme of the University liberal education requirements.",

    "info": "This course examines the politics of social policy in the United States. Recent controversies over Social Security reform, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (?Obamacare?), and the No Child Left Behind Act and Common Core showcase the profound political and substantive impact of this topic. The first half of the course places the United States in comparative perspective. Scholars typically describe the United States as a ?laggard? where social policies developed relatively late, grew relatively slowly, and are less generous than are corresponding policies in other advanced industrial democracies. Is this an accurate portrayal of American social policy? Recent scholarship challenges the conventional wisdom, suggesting that the United States does not necessarily do less in terms of social policy but that it relies on an unusual set of policy tools to pursue objectives like poverty alleviation. What explains the distinctive shape of American social policy? This course investigates the impact of political culture, the relative power of various interest groups, the American constitutional system, and other factors. The second half of the course examines recent trends in American social policy, focusing on four specific policy areas: pensions, health care, education, and income support. It examines both the historical origins of contemporary American policies and recent reform proposals. A major theme of the course is that it is impossible to understand the contemporary shape of social policy, and the positions of specific stakeholders, without understanding the long-term historical processes that have shaped, and that continue to shape, the present political terrain of preferences and actors. New generations of leaders do not have the opportunity to build social policy from scratch. Rather, they have to react to what already exists. Some reforms will seem like logical extensions of what is already in place, while existing programs might make other alternatives difficult if not impossible to pursue. By understanding the roots of contemporary American social policy it becomes possible to devise a political strategy for major policy change.",

    "info": "The appropriate balance of power between the national government and the states has been the subject of intense debate since the United States became an independent country in the eighteenth century, and it has never been resolved. This unresolved controversy has profound democratic and policy implications. Some of the political and social rights that are part and parcel of what it means to be a member of the American community are influenced by geography and the specific state in which an individual resides. For example, state governments make numerous decisions that define voter eligibility, an especially important form of community membership and political participation. In addition, federalism strongly affects the policymaking process. In fields as diverse as environmental protection and health care, the relationship between the national government and the states affects which policies are adopted and how they work in practice. While federalism is rarely at the forefront of the minds of the American public, it plays a central and increasingly important role in the U.S. political system. This course seeks to give students a better understanding of American federalism. By examining both the historical evolution of intergovernmental relations in the United States and contemporary policy debates, it also aims to help students develop the substantive knowledge and analytical skills they need to become critical thinkers. All of the writing assignments that students will complete in the course have been designed with this objective in mind, and the course will emphasize systematic thinking about politics, the explication of logically coherent arguments, and the use of relevant and appropriate empirical evidence to evaluate those arguments. The successful development of the critical thinking and writing skills emphasized in this course will enable students to communicate effectively in a variety of future roles, including as employees and citizens.",

In asking these questions, the goal is to go beyond the often simplistic descriptions of dictators as the all-powerful and omnipotent tyrant, the one who does as he pleases without having to fear any repercussions for his actions. Instead, we will learn that the dictator is only one among may other political elites that make up the regime and to survive, much less thrive, he must traverse the terrain of power politics with the utmost care.",

We will study a range of manifestations of such struggles focusing on some well-known cases such as the US civil rights movement, the Arab Springs, the Ferguson riots and the Islamic State (ISIS). Can non-violent resistance succeed against a coercive state? Why do individuals and groups participate in high-risk political struggles? What explains patterns of violence in civil conflicts? What are the effects of violence? What facilitates peace? This course will enable you to answer these questions.",

By focusing on India, we offer an understanding of the problems of democratization, underdevelopment, governance & political violence. We examine Indias political institutions & challenges confronting the institutions such as socio-economic inequalities, social exclusion, social divisions, ethno-religious & ideological insurgencies, criminalization of politics & rampant corruption. The course enables students to answer important questions: Why did democracy endure in post-colonial India when much of the developing world endured authoritarian regimes? What accounts for the persistence of ethno-religious conflict & violence? What determines a countrys approach to socio-economic development? What accounts for Indias economic development over the last few decades? How do we explain the existence of political democracy and rampant corruption?",

What distinguishes it, however, is the contested nature of state borders, which have been redrawn in ways not observed anywhere else in Africa since the end of European colonialism. The purpose of this class is to delve deeper into these conflicts, to examine the interactions between incumbent governments, armed rebel groups, and international actors in shaping war and peace in the Horn. Throughout this journey, we will pay special attention to ideas of sovereignty, identity, and violence and draw on literature outside of the Horn to help us better dissect what is going on within it.

To avoid such destruction again, a group of European technocrats and leaders embarked on a mission of incrementally deepening economic and later, social partnerships between an ever-expanding number of European countries. These efforts culminated in the birth of the European Union in the late 20th Century. From its inception, the Union has found obstacles in the forms of a weak institutional structure and authority, deep skepticism of a central European authority, financial crisis, ethnic anxiety, and resurgent nationalism. Yet, the continuation and strengthening of the Union is seen as the antidote to the rise of anti-democratic and authoritarian tendencies on the continent. Some of the key questions that we will engage in are: What are the ideological and historical roots of the European Union? What are the structural flaws of the Union?  What are the obstacles to a stronger Union?  Is the Union still or even more essential than ever? What are the ways the Union could collapse from within and from the intervention of outside forces?",

Consistent with the goals of liberal education, this course helps students navigate their way through what is often seen as one of the most perplexing and intractable problems in today's world—racial and ethnic conflicts. It supplies a set of theoretical tools that can be utilized in the most diverse of settings—including, though to a lesser extent, gender. Rather than looking at these conflicts, as the media and popular knowledge often does, as centuries-old conflicts deeply set in our memory banks, a script from which none of us can escape, the course argues that inequalities in power and authority—in other words, class—go a long way in explaining racial and ethnic dynamics. To support this argument, the course examines the so-called “black-white” conflict in three settings, the U.S., South Africa, and Cuba. While all three share certain similarities, their differences provide the most explanatory power. Most instructive is the Cuba versus U.S. and South Africa comparison. Specifically, what are the consequences for race relations when a society, Cuba, attempts to eliminate class inequalities? The course hopes to show that while we all carry with us the legacy of the past, we are not necessarily its prisoners.",

What policies increase or decrease inequality? What are the political consequences of rising inequality - in general and particularly for ethnic and racial minorities? The course focuses on the USA but puts American politics in global perspective. To do so, the course explores how dominant socio-economic groups in the US have historically shaped political institutions and attitudes to generate, perpetuate, and defend inequality.

    "info": "War - both between and within states - is often horrific. With good reason, when the field of international relations emerged in the wake of the world wars, it was centrally preoccupied with shedding light on the causes of war so as thereby to prevent another one. But both interstate and civil wars are remarkably complex affairs. Notwithstanding wars' alarming human costs, their consequences are varied, often cross-cutting, and sometimes contradictory, and they resist our efforts to narrate their consequences in simple and straightforward ways. Wars can increase executive authority and strengthen the state, but they can also undermine inequitable international and domestic political orders, empires, and regimes, and make it possible for more just ones to take their place. Wars can permit repression and exploitation along the lines of race and other categorical identities, but those same experiences can also inspire those groups to demand first-class citizenship. In the name of insecurity and war, governments sometimes trample upon liberties, especially those of the politically weak and unpopular, but those measures may eventually come to seem unwarranted and even provoke a backlash that expands human liberty. War is filled with privation and trauma, but its horrors can also inspire veterans and victims to mobilize and promote more humane norms. We are properly taught to hate war, to avoid it at all costs. Yet social and political good has sometimes, surprisingly, come out of war too. This course explores the consequences of violent conflict in all its dimensions - the threat of conflict, mobilization for conflict, and the experience of warfare - on, among others, international order and norms, the fate of states and empires, population movements, state-building, nationalism, democracy, civil society, the citizenship struggles of racial minorities and other groups, gender roles, economic growth and inequality, the military-industrial complex, public health, and political culture. At this course's end, you will emerge not only with greater substantive understanding of war's consequences, but also with greater appreciation of war's complexity. For better or worse, you will never look at war the same way again.",

    "info": "Karl Marx and Frederick Engels had better democratic credentials than Alexis de Tocqueville and John Stuart Mill.  Vladimir Lenin, too, had better democratic credentials than Max Weber and Woodrow Wilson.  That’s the provocative argument of this course.  Performing what it calls “comparative real-time political analysis,” it presents convincing evidence to sustain both claims.  When the two sets of protagonists are compared and contrasted in how they read and responded to big political events in motion, in real-time, the Marxists, it contends, proved to be better democrats than the Liberals.  Real-time analysis argues that responding to and making decisions about events in motion is the real test of political perspective and theory; on Monday morning, we can all look smart.  The writings and actions of all seven protagonists are the primary course materials—reading them in their own words.  The European Spring of 1848, the United States Civil War, the 1905 Russian Revolution and, the 1917 Russian Revolution and end of World War I, all consequential in the democratic quest, are the main scenarios the course employs to test its claims.  The findings, course participants will learn, challenge assumed political wisdom like never before.  Employing the lessons of the comparisons to trying to make sense of current politics—given the unprecedented moment in which we find ourselves—is the other goal of the course.",

We will look at their explicit reflections on empire, as well as more tangential or ostensibly separate themes that may have only been shaped by the imperial context in indirect ways. Finally, we will reflect upon our contemporary location as readers and agents situated in the wake of these political and intellectual developments, analyzed through the question of what it means to engage in anti-colonial, decolonial, and/or postcolonial critique.

To explore these topics, the field turns to key texts, as well as to political and social events and other media (film, historical documents, etc.). Through this course, students will also be introduced to different interpretive approaches, ranging from democratic theory, feminist, queer and critical race theories, as well as ethics and moral philosophy. Organized around the politics of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the course will pursue a range of questions about democratic legitimation, the exclusion of historically marginalized communities, systematic inequalities of different kinds, as well as ideals of democracy and justice. It will range from theoretical inquiry to practical questions of implementing different political projects. Through this course, students will develop skills in critical thinking, careful reading and clear writing, as well as recognizing and constructing arguments. These skills are basic for the critical, lifelong role that all of us play as members of political community.",

Is adhering to constitutional terms the best way to safeguard rights and to achieve a successful democracy? When and how do constitutions matter to political outcomes? This course centers on these questions as it moves from debates over how constitutional drafting processes should be structured and how detailed constitutions should be, to the risks and benefits of different institutional structures (federal v. unitary, and the distribution of powers between the executive, legislature, and judiciary), to which rights (if any) should be constitutionalized and when and why different rights are protected, closing with a discussion of what rules should guide constitutional amendment and rewrite. For each topic, we compare how these issues have been resolved in the U.S. with alternative approaches in a wide variety of other countries around the globe. The goal is not only to expose students to the variety of ways, successful or unsuccessful, that other political communities have addressed these issues, but also to gain a more contextualized and clearer understanding of the pros and cons of the U.S. model, its relevance for other democratic or democratizing countries, whether and how it might be reformed, and, generally speaking, when/how constitutions matter for democratic quality and stability.",

Despite their best efforts, both Republican and Democratic administrations, the Revolution is still in place after six decades.  How to explain?  This is the central research question of the course.  A definitive answer would require a thorough examination of the revolution from its initiation until today—which is beyond what can be done in a semester.  The focus, rather, is more limited.  First, how was the revolution made and consolidated—from 1953 until about 1969—and, second, how has it been able to survive and advance since the collapse of the Soviet Union, that is, since 1991?  The emphasis here is on the role of leadership and strategy, how the Cubans and their leaders saw and see what they are doing—in their own words.   This is an attempt to get into their heads, their understandings, through documents, speeches and writings. ",
    "prereqInfo": "In keeping with the goals of liberal education, this course helps students to think outside the box of conventional wisdom.  Why, for example, an underdeveloped society lacking many of the characteristics of a liberal democracy can do a better job in meeting the basic needs of its citizens than its far richer neighbor to the north? What the Cubans seek to do is reorganize human relations on the basis of solidarity and not individual self-interest.  How successful they have been in that pursuit is exactly one of the questions to which the course seeks to provide an answer.  These questions are not simply of intellectual interest.  Given the deepening crisis of world capitalism with the accompanying human misery, to know about Cuba's reality can have life and death consequences.  Given, also, that the U.S. government doesn’t make it easy for most of its citizens to travel to the island to make up their own minds about its reality, this course is a unique educational opportunity.",

    "info": "Twenty five years ago, Russia appeared to be democratizing and was even on friendly relations with the US and NATO. Now Vladimir Putin runs the state with the FSB (KGB), and US-Russian relations are at their worst point since the 1970s. This course examines major themes and periods in Soviet and Post-Soviet Russian politics. It begins with the Russian Revolution of 1917, and continues with a study of the creation of the USSR and Soviet rule under Lenin, Stalin, and later decades. We look in depth at the economic and political system set up by the Communist Party, and at the causes of its collapse in 1991, which has had profound legacies for the post-Soviet development of Russia. Then in the second half of the course we turn to themes of political, economic, social and civic development under Yeltsin and Putin. We will pose the following questions: Why does democratization begin and why does it fail? How is economic reform undermined? What type of state and regime is Russia now? What caused the Chechen wars and the massive bloodshed in the Caucasus during this period? Is Putin trying to recreate the Soviet Union and retake control of its neighbors? Are US-Russian relations improving as a result of Obama's \\\"Reset,\\\" or are we now in an era of a new Cold War? What is Russia's goal in Syria, Iran, or Central Asia? Is Putin rebuilding Russia, or driving it to disaster, and how will this impact the West?",

As well as the streets, the barricades and the battlefields, it argues, are decisive in the democratic quest.  If democracy means the rule of the demos, the people, then who gets to be included in “the people\\\"?  An underlying assumption of the course is that the inclusion of previously disenfranchised layers of society into the category of the people, the citizens, is due to social struggles or the threat of such—an assumption to be examined in the course.  Struggles refer to any kinds of movement for social change, from protests and strikes to revolutions broadly defined. This course seeks to see if there are lessons of struggle. The course traces the history of the democratic movement from its earliest moments in human history and attempts to draw a balance sheet.  In the process it seeks to answer a number of questions.  Did social inequality always exist?  How do property rights figure in the inclusion process?  What is the relationship between the state, social inequality and democracy?  Which social layers played a decisive role in the democratic breakthrough?  What are the effective strategies and tactics in the democratic struggle?  How crucial is leadership?  And lastly, can the lessons of the past inform current practice?  A particular feature of the course is to read about the thinking and actions of activists on both sides of the democratic struggle in, as much as possible, their own words.",

Specific topics addressed include accountability for past and present mass violence; origins of and responses to crime, from \\\"mano dura\\\" policies to criminal justice reform and anti-corruption initiatives; and advances and limitations in equal rights protection. Special attention is paid across the course to issues of indigeneity, race, class, gender, and sexuality. Throughout, students compare situations within Latin America, which is by no means a monolith, as well as consider parallels between Latin America and the United States, where, despite great differences in wealth, history and culture, similar problems of law and justice can be found. The course aims thus not only to teach students about Latin America but also to get students to think about what we might learn from Latin America.",

In doing so, we'll also get a look at some of the major controversies in this area of study, particularly the issues of whether the \\\"old-fashioned racism\\\" of the pre-civil-rights era has been replaced by new forms of racism; and the degree to which debates over policy matters with no apparent link to race - such as crime and social welfare - may actually have a lot to do with racial attitudes. Finally, we will conclude by taking an informed look at racial attitudes in recent American history, focusing on how racial attitudes and their political consequences of have changed - and not changed - over the course of the Obama presidency and the tumultuous 2016 election.",

A third theme explores the strategic and ethical implications of the use of force and especially of innovation in military technologies - nuclear weapons, cyber, drones. Across all three sections, we examine how war and society mutually affect each other, including how racial, ethnic, and other categorical identities affect critical dynamics in security, from threat perception to military mobilization.",

Is adhering to constitutional terms the best way to safeguard rights and to achieve a successful democracy? When and how do constitutions matter to political outcomes? This course centers on these questions as it moves from debates over how constitutional drafting processes should be structured and how detailed constitutions should be, to the risks and benefits of different institutional structures (federal v. unitary, and the distribution of powers between the executive, legislature, and judiciary), to which rights (if any) should be constitutionalized and when and why different rights are protected, closing with a discussion of what rules should guide constitutional amendment and rewrite. For each topic, we compare how these issues have been resolved in the U.S. with alternative approaches in a wide variety of other countries around the globe. The goal is not only to expose students to the variety of ways, successful or unsuccessful, that other political communities have addressed these issues, but also to gain a more contextualized and clearer understanding of the pros and cons of the U.S. model, its relevance for other democratic or democratizing countries, whether and how it might be reformed, and, generally speaking, when/how constitutions matter for democratic quality and stability.",

We will explore these political dynamics in Southeast Asia, one of the most culturally and politically diverse regions of the globe. Composed of eleven countries, Southeast Asia covers a wide geographical region stretching from India to China. With a rich endowment of natural resources, a dynamic manufacturing base, and a strategic location on China's southern flank, the region has come to play an increasingly important role in the political and economic affairs of the globe. Culturally and ethnically diverse, hundreds of languages are spoken, and the religions practiced include Buddhism, Catholicism, Hinduism, and Islam. The region is similarly diverse in its political systems, which range from democratic to semi-democratic to fully authoritarian. ",

Students reflect on and debate the causes behind the varied outcomes, as well as the effectiveness, actual and potential, of the different institutional and social change efforts that have been underway in the region since the 1980s. Specific topics addressed include accountability for past and present mass violence; origins of and responses to crime, from \\\"mano dura\\\" policies to criminal justice reform and anti-corruption initiatives; and advances and limitations in equal rights protection. Special attention is paid across the course to issues of indigeneity, race, class, gender, and sexuality. Throughout, students compare situations within Latin America, which is by no means a monolith, as well as consider parallels between Latin America and the United States, where, despite great differences in wealth, history and culture, similar problems of law and justice can be found. The course aims thus not only to teach students about Latin America but also to get students to think about what we might learn from Latin America.",

    "info": "This is a graduate seminar that examines seminal interdisciplinary research on the role of international laws, institutions, and regulations in world politics. Its objective is to enhance your understanding of the ways in which international rules shape international and domestic politics, practices, values, and relations. To what extent does international law help resolve conflicts between countries? What is its relationship with governments’ foreign policies? To what extent has international law helped governments achieve common goals or express important values? How does international law interact with domestic politics, legal systems, or cultures? Throughout the course, we emphasize the relationship between law and politics and seek to understand the nature of international law and transnational regulatory standards.\nThe course is divided into three main parts. First, we will explore a variety of approaches to conceptualizing and analyzing international rules and institutions. This part will consider different reasons for legalizing cooperation, the role of domestic politics in the turn to international law and regulation, institutional design considerations, and the process and politics of delegating authority to a supranational legal body. The second part of the course examines tools and approaches scholars use to evaluate the effectiveness or effects of these efforts. We assess whether and how legal or regulatory institutions engender compliance with rules; explore different ways in which they can have an effect on the behavior, beliefs, and identities of a range of actors; and interrogate the intended and unintended consequences of legal regulation in global politics. Finally, after workshopping our own research, we consider broader implications of the turn to international law in terms of complexity, fragmentation, backlash, and pressing problems for the current political moment.",
