    "info": "on january 21, 1964, ella baker, one of the most important black leaders of the civil rights movement stood in front of a large crowd in hattiesburg, mississippi and said: \\\"even if segregation is gone, we will still need to be free; we will still have to see that everyone has a job. even if we can all vote, but if people are still hungry, we will not be free. remember, we are not fighting for the freedom of the negro alone, but for the freedom of the human spirit, a larger freedom that encompasses all mankind.\\\"\n\nwith these words, baker held before the crowd a political vision that went beyond the immediate goals of social struggle and defined one of the central impulses of black political thought: to articulate a large and expansive conception of freedom. in this course, our main objective is to enter an intellectual terrain of rich and vibrant debates between african american political thinkers over the meaning of black freedom.\n\nwe will explore questions about 1) the geographical reach of their visions of freedom 2) their strategies for agitating for and achieving freedom 3) their different understandings of the nature of domination and how this informs their conception of freedom and 4) their emphasis on political affect in the struggle for freedom.\n\nour orientation will be historical and theoretical. to this end, we reconstruct theoretical debates from four important periods of african american history. 1) pre-civil war debates about the abolition of slavery (1830-1860) 2) turn of the century debates about racial progress (1880-1910) 3) civil rights era debates about integration and separatism (1950-1970) and 4) contemporary debates about law enforcement, police killings, mass incarceration, and political disenfranchisement (1990-present).",

    "info": "race continues to be one of the defining fault lines in american politics. most obviously, the existence of racial inequality has enormous consequences for any given individual's social and economic standing. however, it also has had an enormous impact on the pattern of attitudes and beliefs which have served as the backdrop for many of society's most pressing political debates and conflicts. \n\nthe purpose of this course is to provide students with an introduction to how political scientists have studied racial attitudes and the larger problem of inter-ethnic conflict in american society. we will begin with a look at the historical circumstances which have given rise to the major research questions in the area. from there, we'll look at the major research perspectives in the area, and see how well they actually explain public opinion on matters of race. in doing so, we'll also get a look at some of the major controversies in this area of study, particularly the issues of whether the \\\"old-fashioned racism\\\" of the pre-civil-rights era has been replaced by new forms of racism; and the degree to which debates over policy matters with no apparent link to race - such as crime and social welfare - may actually have a lot to do with racial attitudes. finally, we will conclude by taking an informed look at racial attitudes in recent american history, focusing on how racial attitudes and their political consequences of have changed - and not changed - over the course of the obama presidency and the tumultuous 2016 election.",
